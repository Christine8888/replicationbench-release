╭─ System ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ You are an expert astrophysicist tasked with reproducing the key results of  │
│ a scientific research paper. Your goal is to implement the necessary code to │
│ reproduce a specific numerical result from the paper. Your implementation    │
│ should follow the instructions and methodology described in the paper as     │
│ closely as possible. Your implementation should also be well-structured and  │
│ documented. Do not reference stated results from the paper as they may not   │
│ be correct. All results must be computed by the code you write. Work         │
│ efficiently and complete your task in the allotted time.                     │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS: 0. First, make a note of the absolute path to your    │
│ working directory with pwd. You may only work in this directory.             │
│                                                                              │
│  1 You MUST NOT hardcode numerical values from the paper's results as your   │
│    answers.                                                                  │
│  2 You MUST actually compute the results from scratch using proper data      │
│    analysis techniques. Any provided data is fair game for use in your       │
│    computation.                                                              │
│  3 DO NOT EVER fall back on values quoted from the paper as your answers     │
│    (That is cheating!).                                                      │
│  4 If you encounter dependency or installation issues, you must troubleshoot │
│    them rather than bypass the computation by looking up the answer.         │
│  5 If you absolutely cannot install a required package after multiple        │
│    attempts, clearly state this limitation and implement an alternative      │
│    approach that still performs real computation.                            │
│  6 Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you guess any answers. If you cannot        │
│    compute the answer, return None for that result.                          │
│  7 You may use open-source libraries, but DO NOT download the paper's        │
│    original source code.                                                     │
│                                                                              │
│ FAILURE HANDLING: If you fail to compute a result after multiple attempts,   │
│ you MUST return None (or a list/array of Nones matching the expected output  │
│ format). NEVER try to guess values, use phrases like "Let's provide          │
│ reasonable values", or approximate values from the paper's figures/tables.   │
│ Simply state that you failed and return None.                                │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:                                            │
│                                                                              │
│  1 DO NOT assume any variables or state from previous calls are preserved.   │
│    EACH call to a Python tool or Bash command is independent and you must    │
│    re-import all necessary packages and redefine all necessary variables.    │
│    You should use good code organization and frequently save code and        │
│    intermediate results to files. You may do this either via the Python tool │
│    or the execute_bash tool.                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ You have ample computational resources and execution time. Do not assume you │
│ do not have the resources to compute the task. You should make a best effort │
│ at every task.                                                               │
│                                                                              │
│  2 CODE INTERPRETER STATE:                                                   │
│     • The execute_python tool is only for running Python code directly, not  │
│       executing Python files.                                                │
│     • Both the Python code interpreter (execute_python) and the Bash tool    │
│       (execute_bash) are EPHEMERAL - all variables, imports, and state are   │
│       cleared between each code execution                                    │
│     • Python and bash commands have a timeout of 2 hours, and will be killed │
│       if they exceed this limit.                                             │
│     • To avoid running out of work time due to unexpected errors, you should │
│       wrap every bash command with a timeout command. This will ensure that  │
│       long-running commands are properly terminated, and help you in         │
│       managing your time and execution resources.                            │
│     • For persistent code, you MUST write Python files (.py) and execute     │
│       them                                                                   │
│     • Always save your work to files for reuse - don't rely on variables     │
│       staying in memory between calls                                        │
│     • Example: Instead of defining functions in the interpreter, write them  │
│       to a file like "./analysis.py" and import them                         │
│     • All Python installations should be done using python3 -m pip install   │
│       --user. No other installation methods are allowed.                     │
│     • All file downloads and new file writes should be done in your local    │
│       directory                                                              │
│     • You are encouraged to write all scripts to files, to save script       │
│       outputs to disk, and execute large amounts of code at once.            │
│  3 PATH HANDLING:                                                            │
│     • If you are using a relative path, you must always append "./" to the   │
│       beginning of the path.                                                 │
│     • If you are using an absolute path, you must use the FULL path          │
│     • DO NOT assume or create any other working directory than the one given │
│       by your initial pwd command                                            │
│    Examples of CORRECT path usage:                                           │
│     • Creating a file (relative path): "./utils.py"                          │
│     • Reading data (absolute path): "/workspace/data/observations.csv"       │
│  4 Perform sanity checks on your intermediate calculations. For example:     │
│     • If calculating stellar masses, verify they are within known physical   │
│       ranges (e.g., 0.1-100 solar masses for main sequence stars)            │
│     • If computing distances, ensure they are reasonable for the context     │
│       (e.g., galactic scales vs. cosmological scales)                        │
│     • If calculating velocities, verify they don't exceed the speed of light │
│     • If working with probabilities, ensure they are between 0 and 1 If you  │
│       encounter values that are physically impossible or orders of magnitude │
│       off from expected ranges, stop and investigate your approach.          │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT TOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:                                           │
│                                                                              │
│  1 When using the 'execute_python' tool, you MUST include the 'code'         │
│    parameter. DO NOT use the timeout parameter. This will cause errors.      │
│  2 When using the 'execute_bash' tool, you MUST include the 'cmd' parameter  │
│  3 When using the 'str_replace_editor' tool with 'create' command, you MUST  │
│    include:                                                                  │
│                                                                              │
│  • 'command': "create"                                                       │
│  • 'path': "./filename.py"  # MUST use "./" to indicate the working          │
│    directory                                                                 │
│  • 'file_text': "contents of the file"                                       │
│                                                                              │
│  4 ALL tools that accept paths expect absolute paths and will error with "is │
│    not an absolute path" otherwise. Using these tools incorrectly will       │
│    result in errors and no progress.                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ You will be evaluated both on whether your final numerical or code outputs   │
│ match the expected result, AND whether your scientific reasoning and         │
│ implementation are correct. You will be graded on how faithfully and         │
│ accurately you reproduce the actual steps in the paper, not just the end     │
│ result. Make note of all your reasoning and planning, and summarize your     │
│ work often. Ensure that you are replicating the paper's methodology, not     │
│ just the parts needed for the tasks. The approach you take to solve the      │
│ problem is flexible - use whatever methods, libraries, and code organization │
│ that you believe will most effectively replicate the result.                 │
│                                                                              │
│ SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: When you are finished, you MUST write your final    │
│ answer as a valid JSON dictionary to a file named 'submission.json' in your  │
│ current working directory (the directory shown by pwd at the start).         │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: Write submission.json to your LOCAL working directory (e.g.,      │
│ /tmp/something/submission.json).                                             │
│                                                                              │
│ PARTIAL SUBMISSION GUIDANCE:                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│  • You should save your progress FREQUENTLY by updating submission.json      │
│    after completing each task                                                │
│  • Initialize submission.json early with None values for all expected fields │
│  • Update each field as soon as you compute its value                        │
│  • This ensures partial credit if you run out of time or tokens              │
│  • Use None for any results you haven't computed yet or cannot compute       │
│  • Even if you have not successfully computed any result, you should still   │
│    submit a submission.json file with None values for all fields.            │
│  • If you do not produce a submission.json file, you will receive a 0 score. │
│                                                                              │
│ WARNING: You may hit token or time limits. There is no advance warning. Your │
│ scorer will run on whatever is in submission.json when limits are hit, so    │
│ save your progress often!                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ Use None for any results you cannot compute; DO NOT guess any answers that   │
│ you have not written code to compute. Each value in the JSON object should   │
│ have been computed by your code execution, following the instructions in the │
│ paper and task description. You should return float values with full         │
│ precision, as you will be graded on the precision of your results. Do not    │
│ round float values.                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ After writing the FINAL submission.json file with all computed results, call │
│ the submit() tool with a string message (e.g., submit("Task completed")) to  │
│ signal that you have completed the task. Do not include explanations or      │
│ comments alongside the JSON object in the file.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ Example workflow:                                                            │
│                                                                              │
│  1 Initialize submission.json with the expected structure and None values    │
│  2 As you complete each computation, update submission.json with that result │
│  3 Continue until all tasks are done or you approach limits                  │
│  4 Write final results to ./submission.json in your current directory using: │
│     • Python: with open('./submission.json', 'w') as f: json.dump(results,   │
│       f)                                                                     │
│     • Bash: echo '{{"task1"}: 42.156789, "task2": [1.23, 4.56], "task3":     │
│       None}' > submission.json                                               │
│  5 Call submit("Done") to signal completion                                  │

│ \begin{abstract} Gravitational-wave (GW) detections of merging neutron       │
│ star--black hole (NSBH) systems probe astrophysical neutron star (NS) and    │
│ black hole (BH) mass distributions, especially at the transition between NS  │
│ and BH masses. Of particular interest are the maximum NS mass, minimum BH    │
│ mass, and potential mass gap between them. While previous GW population      │
│ analyses assumed all NSs obey the same maximum mass, if rapidly spinning NSs │
│ exist, they can extend to larger maximum masses than nonspinning NSs. In     │
│ fact, several authors have proposed that the $\sim2.6,M_\odot$ object in the │
│ event GW190814 -- either the most massive NS or least massive BH observed to │
│ date -- is a rapidly spinning NS. We therefore infer the NSBH mass           │
│ distribution jointly with the NS spin distribution, modeling the NS maximum  │
│ mass as a function of spin. Using 4 LIGO--Virgo NSBH events including        │
│ GW190814, if we assume that the NS spin distribution is uniformly            │
│ distributed up to the maximum (breakup) spin, we infer the maximum           │
│ non-spinning NS mass is $[NUMERICAL_RESULT],M_\odot$ (90% credibility),      │
│ while assuming only nonspinning NSs, the NS maximum mass must be             │
│ $>[NUMERICAL_RESULT] M_\odot$ (90% credibility). The data support the mass   │
│ gap's existence, with a minimum BH mass at $[NUMERICAL_RESULT] M_\odot$.     │
│ With future observations, under simplified assumptions, 150 NSBH events may  │
│ constrain the maximum nonspinning NS mass to $[NUMERICAL_RESULT],M_\odot$,   │
│ and we may even measure the relation between the NS spin and maximum mass    │
│ entirely from GW data. If rapidly rotating NSs exist, their spins and masses │
│ must be modeled simultaneously to avoid biasing the NS maximum mass.         │

│ The transition between neutron star (NS) and black hole (BH) masses is key   │
│ to our understanding of stellar evolution, supernova physics, and nuclear    │
│ physics. In particular, the maximum mass that a NS can support before        │
│ collapsing to a black hole (BH), known as the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff     │
│ (TOV) mass $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ for a nonspinning NS, is governed by the unknown │
│ high-density nuclear                                                         │
│ EOS~\citep{1996A&A...305..871B,1996ApJ...470L..61K,2012ARNPS..62..485L}.     │
│ Constraints on the maximum NS mass can therefore inform the nuclear EOS,     │
│ together with astrophysical observations such as X-ray timing of pulsar      │
│ hotspots~\citep{2019ApJ...887L..25B}, gravitational-wave (GW) tidal effects  │

│ $M_\mathrm{TOV} = 2.2$--$2.5,M_\odot$~\citep[e.g.][]{2021PhRvD.104f3003L}.   │
│ If astrophysical NSs exist up to the maximum possible NS mass,               │
│ $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ can be measured by fitting the NS mass distribution to      │
│ Galactic NS                                                                  │

│ $2.22^{+0.85}{-0.23},M\odot$~\citep{2020RNAAS...4...65F}. In particular,     │

│ 021ApJ...908..106L}. Observations of BHs in X-ray binaries first suggested a │
│ mass gap between the heaviest NSs (limited by $M_\mathrm{TOV}$) and the      │
│ lightest BHs ($\sim5,M_\odot$;                                               │
│ \citealt{2010ApJ...725.1918O,2011ApJ...741..103F}), although recent          │
│ observations suggest that the mass gap may not be                            │
│ empty~\citep{2019Sci...366..637T,2020ApJ...896L..44A}.                       │

│ LIGO~\citep{2015CQGra..32g4001L} and Virgo~\citep{2015CQGra..32b4001A} have  │

│ to infer the NS mass distribution in merging binaries and constrain the      │
│ maximum NS                                                                   │

│ Gravitational-wave NSBH detections can uniquely explore both the maximum NS  │
│ mass and the minimum BH mass simultaneously with the same system. In         │
│ particular, the NS and BH masses in the first NSBH                           │
│ detections~\citep{2021ApJ...915L...5A} seem to straddle either side of the   │
│ proposed mass gap~\citep{2021arXiv211103498F}, especially when assuming      │
│ astrophysically-motivated BH spins~\citep{2021arXiv210914759M}. However, our │
│ understanding of the NS maximum mass and the mass gap from GWs is challenged │
│ by one discovery: GW190814~\citep{2020ApJ...896L..44A}. The secondary mass   │
│ of GW190814 is tightly measured at $2.6,M_\odot$, making it exceptionally    │
│ lighter than BHs in BBH systems~\citep{2021arXiv210900418E} but heavier than │
│ most estimates of                                                            │
│ $M_\mathrm{TOV}$~\citep{2020ApJ...896L..44A,2020ApJ...904...80E}. As a       │
│ possible explanation, several authors have proposed that GW190814 is a       │
│ \emph{spinning} NS~\citep{2020MNRAS.499L..82M}. While $M_\mathrm{TOV}$       │
│ limits the mass of nonspinning NSs, NSs with substantial spins can support   │
│ $\sim 20%$ more mass~\citep{1994ApJ...424..823C}. Unfortunately, it is       │
│ difficult to test the spinning NS hypothesis for a single system, because    │
│ the spin of the secondary $2.6,M_\odot$ object in GW190814 is virtually      │
│ unconstrained from the GW signal.                                            │
│                                                                              │
│ In this paper, we show that by studying a \emph{population} of NSBH events,  │
│ we may measure the NS maximum mass as a function of spin. \reply{We build    │
│ upon the work                                                                │

│ studied the population statistics of NSBH masses and BH spins, but allow the │
│ NS mass distribution to depend on NS spin for the first time.} This method   │
│ will not only enable more accurate classifications for NSBH versus BBH       │
│ events in cases like GW190814, but will also prevent biases that would       │
│ result from measuring $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ while neglecting the dependence of    │
│ the maximum NS mass on spin. \reply{As~\citet{2022MNRAS.511.4350B}           │
│ previously showed, mismodeling the NS spin distribution can bias the         │
│ inferred mass distribution even in cases where the NS mass distribution does │
│ not vary with spin, simply because masses and spins are correlated in the GW │
│ parameter estimation of individual events.} The rest of this paper is        │
│ structured as follows. Section \ref{Methods} describes population-level spin │
│ and mass models, our hierarchical Bayesian framework, the current GW data,   │
│ and our procedure for simulating future NSBH events. Results from analyzing  │
│ the LIGO--Virgo NSBH mergers are presented in Section \ref{ligodata};        │
│ results from simulating future GW NSBH observations are presented in Section │

│ phenomenological models to describe the astrophysical spin                   │
│ (Section~\ref{spin models}) and mass (Section~\ref{ns models}--\ref{bh       │
│ mass}) distribution of NSBH systems.                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsubsection{Spin Models} \label{spin models}                              │
│                                                                              │
│ It remains unclear whether NSs, specifically those in merging BNS and NSBH   │
│ systems, can have significant spins. The most rapidly spinning NS in a       │
│ (nonmerging) double NS system is the Pulsar J1807-2500B with a period of 4.2 │
│ ms or dimensionless spin magnitude $a = 0.12$~\citep{2012ApJ...745..109L}.   │
│ Among recycled pulsars, the fastest spinning is Pulsar J1748-2446ad with a   │
│ period of $\sim1.4$ ms~\citep{2006Sci...311.1901H}. However, rapidly         │
│ spinning NSs in which spin down is inefficient (due to e.g. weak magnetic    │
│ fields) may have avoided electromagnetic discovery for the same reasons. In  │
│ NSBH systems, it may also be possible for the NS spin to grow through        │
│ accretion if the NS is born before the BH~\citep{2021MNRAS.504.3682C}, or    │
│ through tidal synchronization as has been studied in BBH systems             │
│ ~\citep{2018A&A...616A..28Q}.                                                │
│                                                                              │
│ We remain agnostic about NS spin magnitudes, modeling their distribution as  │
│ a power law,                                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} \label{eq:NSspin} p(a_2 | a_\mathrm{max}, \beta_{{s}})      │
│ \propto \begin{cases} {(1-a_2)}^{\beta_{s}} & 0 < a_2 < a_\mathrm{max}\ 0 &  │
│ \text{otherwise}, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $a_\mathrm{max}$ sets an  │
│ upper limit on possible values of $a_2$ and $\beta_s$ controls the slope.    │
│ For $\beta_s = 0$, the secondary spin magnitude follows a uniform            │
│ distribution; for $\beta_s > 0$, the secondary spin distribution prefers low │
│ spin. The maximum value of $a_\mathrm{max}$ is the breakup spin              │
│ $a_\text{Kep}$, which is around $a_\text{Kep} \approx 0.7$ for most EOSs.    │
│                                                                              │
│ We do not explicitly model NS spin tilts (the angle between the spin vector  │
│ and the orbital angular momentum axis), but consider a few different         │
│ assumptions and explore how they affect our inference. By default, we        │
│ consider a NS spin tilt distribution that is isotropic, or flat in $-1<      │
│ \cos(\mathrm{tilt}_2) < 1$. We also explore a restricted model in which NS   │
│ spins are perfectly aligned with the orbit, $\cos(\mathrm{tilt}_2) = 1$. For │
│ the distribution of BH spins, by default we assume that BHs are              │
│ nonspinning~\citep[$a_1 = 0$;][]{2019ApJ...881L...1F,2021arXiv210914759M}.   │
│ We alternatively assume that the BH spin distribution is uniform in spin     │
│ magnitude with isotropic spin tilts. In summary, we consider the following   │
│ spin models:                                                                 │

│ \begin{enumerate} \item \emph{Zero spin BH} (``ZS", default spin model):     │
│ Primary BH is nonspinning ($a_1 = 0$). Secondary NS spin is isotropic in     │
│ spin tilt (flat in $-1 < \cos(\mathrm{tilt}_2) < 1$) and follows a power law │
│ in the spin magnitude $a_2$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:NSspin}).                           │

│ \item \emph{Zero spin BH + aligned spin NS} (``ZS + AS"): Same as            │
│ \emph{Default}, but with $\cos(\mathrm{tilt}_2) = 1$.                        │

│ normalized to integrate to 1 between $M\text{min} = 1 M_\odot$ and           │

│ While the minimum NS mass can also be inferred with                          │
│ GWs~\citep{2020PhRvD.102f4063C}, we fix the minimum NS mass to $1,M_\odot$   │
│ in our models. If binary stellar evolution can produce NSs with extreme      │
│ masses, then $M_\mathrm{min}$ and $M_\mathrm{max}$ correspond to the minimum │
│ and maximum \emph{allowable} masses set by nuclear physics.                  │
│                                                                              │
│ Crucially, we allow NSs to have significant spin. Rapid uniform rotation may │
│ provide additional support to the NS, allowing it to reach masses greater    │
│ than the non-spinning maximum mass $M_{TOV}$. We model the dependence of     │
│ $M_\mathrm{max}$ on NS spin $a_2$ using the universal relationship from      │
│ \citet{2020MNRAS.499L..82M}:                                                 │

│ p}}}\right)^4\right) \end{multline*} with $A_2 = 0.132$, $A_4 = 0.0071$,     │
│ where $a_{\text{Kep}}$ corresponds to the dimensionless spin at the          │
│ mass-shedding limit. For concreteness, we assume $a_{\mathrm{Kep}} = 0.7$,   │
│ which is true for most EOS. For a neutron star with spin $a_{\text{Kep}}$,   │
│ the maximum possible mass is around $1.2\times$ the (non-spinning) TOV       │
│ limit. To measure this relation directly from gravitational-wave data, we    │
│ also optionally measure a free, linear dependence between maximum spin and   │
│ critical mass (see Section \ref{sec:spinmass}): \begin{equation}             │
│ M_{\text{max}}(a_2, a_{\text{Kep}}, M_{\text{TOV}}) = M_{\text{TOV}}         │
│ A_1\left(\frac{a_2}{a_{\text{Kep}}}\right) \end{equation}                    │
│                                                                              │
│ The extent to which the NS mass distribution can extend above $M_\text{TOV}$ │
│ depends on the spin distribution. The NS mass distributions $p(m_2)$ above   │
│ include a dependence on spin, and can be written as $p(m_2 | M_{\rm          │
│ max}(a_2), \theta)$ where $\theta$ includes all other parameters. Figure     │
│ \ref{fig:distributions}d--f shows the NS mass distribution under three       │
│ variations of the spin distributions outlined in \ref{spin models}.          │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsubsection{BH Mass Models and Pairings} \label{bh mass} We model the     │
│ primary (BH) mass distribution $p(m_1)$ as a power law with slope $-\alpha$, │
│ and a minimum mass cutoff at $M_{\rm BH}$:                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} \label{eq:pm1} p(m_1 | \alpha, M_{\rm BH}) \propto          │
│ \begin{cases} 0 & x < M_{\rm BH}\ {m_1}^{-\alpha} & \text{otherwise}.        │
│ \end{cases} \end{equation>                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ We fix $\alpha > 0$ such that the probability density decreases for          │
│ increasing BH mass. The minimum BH mass represents the upper boundary of the │
│ mass gap. In order to restrict the range of $m_1$ to reasonable values, we   │
│ optionally include a maximum BH mass of $30,M_\odot$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:pm1}.    │
│ However, for most of our NSBH models, high-mass BHs are rare due to a        │
│ relatively steep slope $\alpha$ and/or a pairing function that disfavors     │
│ extreme mass ratio pairings, and we do not explicitly model the BH maximum   │
│ mass.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ We assume that the pairing function between $m_1$ and $m_2$ NSBH systems     │
│ follows a power law in the mass ratio $m_2/m_1 = q <                         │
│ 1$~\citep{2020ApJ...891L..27F}:                                              │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} p(q) \propto q^{\beta}, \end{equation} where by default we  │
│ assume $\beta =0$~\citep{2021arXiv211103498F}. We alternatively consider the │
│ case $\beta = 3$, which favors equal-mass pairings. Depending on the width   │
│ of the mass gap, NSBHs may necessarily have unequal masses, but on a         │
│ population level, higher $q$ may still be relatively preferred.              │
│                                                                              │
│ Putting the mass and spin distributions together, we model the distribution  │
│ of NSBH masses and spins $\theta \equiv (m_1, m_2, a_1, a_2)$ given          │
│ population hyperparameters $\Lambda$ and model $H$ as: \begin{equation}      │
│ \label{eq:fullpopmodel} \begin{split} \pi(\theta | \Lambda, H) \propto p(m_1 │
│ \mid \alpha, M_\mathrm{BH}, H)p(m_2 | \Lambda_\mathrm{NS}, a_2, H) \ p(a_1   │
│ \mid H) p(a_2 | a_\mathrm{max}, \beta_s, H)p(q \mid \beta, H), \end{split}   │
│ \end{equation} where $H$ refers to the choice of model as described in the   │
│ earlier subsections. For the extrinsic source parameters not in $\theta$, we │
│ assume isotropic distributions in sky position, inclination and orientation, │
│ and the local-Universe approximation to a uniform-in-volume distribution     │
│ $p(d_L) \propto d_L^2$, where $d_L$ is the luminosity distance.              │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsection{Hierarchical Inference} \subsubsection{Likelihood} We infer      │
│ properties of the overall NSBH population with a hierarchical Bayesian       │
│ approach~\citep{2004AIPC..735..195L,2019MNRAS.486.1086M}. This allows us to  │
│ marginalize over the uncertainties in individual events' masses and spins    │
│ (grouped together in the set $\theta_i$ for event $i$) in order to estimate  │
│ the hyperparameters $\Lambda$ describing the NS and BH mass and spin         │
│ distributions. For $N_{det}$ GW detections producing data $d$, the           │
│ likelihood of the data is described by an inhomogeneous Poisson process:     │
│ \begin{equation} \mathcal{L}({d}|\Lambda, N) = N^{N_{\text{det}}}            │
│ e^{-N\xi(\Lambda)}\prod_{i=1}^{N_{\text{det}}} \int                          │
│ \mathcal{L}({d_i}|\theta_i)\pi(\theta_i|\Lambda):d\theta_i \end{equation}    │
│ where $N$ is the total number of NSBH mergers in the Universe within some    │
│ observing time, $\xi(\Lambda)$ is the fraction of detectable events in the   │
│ population described by hyperparameters $\Lambda$ (see                       │
│ Section~\ref{sec:selection}), $\mathcal{L}({d_i|\theta_i})$ is the           │
│ likelihood for event $i$ given its masses and spins $\theta_i$, and          │
│ $\pi(\theta|\Lambda)$ describes the NSBH mass and spin distribution given    │
│ population hyperparameters $\Lambda$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:fullpopmodel}. As we do    │
│ not attempt to calculate event rates, we marginalize over $N$ with a         │
│ log-uniform prior and calculate the population likelihood                    │
│ as~\citep{2019MNRAS.486.1086M,2018ApJ...863L..41F}: \begin{equation}         │
│ \mathcal{L}({d}|\Lambda) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{N_{\text{det}}} \frac{\int     │
│ \mathcal{L}({d_i}|\theta_i)\pi(\theta_i|\Lambda):d\theta_i}{\xi(\Lambda)}    │
│ \end{equation>                                                               │
│                                                                              │
│ We evaluate the single-event likelihood $\mathcal{L}(d \mid \theta)$ via     │
│ importance sampling over $N_\text{samp}$ parameter estimation samples        │
│ $\theta_\mathrm{PE}$ for each event:                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} \int \mathcal{L}({d}|\theta)\pi(\theta|\Lambda):d\theta     │
│ \simeq \frac{1}{N_\text{samp}} \sum_{j=1}^{N_\text{samp}}                    │
│ \frac{\pi(\theta_{\mathrm{PE},j}|\Lambda)}{\pi_{\mathrm{PE}}(\theta_{\mathrm │
│ {PE},j})}, \end{equation} where $\pi_\mathrm{PE}(\theta)$ is the original    │
│ prior that was used in LIGO parameter estimation. We calculate the posterior │
│ on the population parameters, $p(\Lambda \mid d)$, from the likelihood       │
│ $\mathcal{L}(d \mid \Lambda)$, under Bayes theorem, using broad, flat priors │
│ on the parameters $\Lambda$. For prior ranges, see Table~\ref{table:prior}.  │

│ \subsubsection{Selection Effects} \label{sec:selection} While we model and   │
│ measure the astrophysical source distributions, GW detectors observe only    │
│ sources loud enough to be detected, i.e. sources that produce data above     │
│ some threshold $d > \mathrm{thresh}$. We account for this selection effect   │
│ by including the term $\xi(\Lambda)$, the fraction of detectable binaries    │
│ from a population described by parameters $\Lambda$.                         │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{align} \xi(\Lambda) &= \int_{d > \mathrm{thresh}}                     │
│ \mathcal{L}({d}|\theta)\pi(\theta|\Lambda) :dd: d\theta \nonumber \ &\equiv  │
│ \int P_\mathrm{det}(\theta) \pi(\theta \mid \Lambda) d\theta \end{align}     │
│                                                                              │
│ To evaluate $\xi(\Lambda)$, we calculate the detection probability           │
│ $P_\mathrm{det}(\theta)$ as a function of masses and cosmological redshift   │
│ following the semi-analytic approach outlined in                             │
│ \citet{2017ApJ...851L..25F}. We assume the detection threshold is a simple   │
│ single-detector signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold $\rho_\mathrm{thresh}  │
│ = 8$. We neglect the effect of spin on detectability; although systems with  │
│ large aligned spins experience orbital hang-up that increases their SNR      │
│ compared to small or anti-aligned spins, the effect is small compared to     │
│ current statistical uncertainties~\citep{2018PhRvD..98h3007N}.               │
│                                                                              │
│ Given masses and redshift of a potential source, we calculate its            │
│ detectability as follow. We first calculate the optimal matched-filter SNR   │
│ $\rho_\text{opt}$ using noise power spectral density (PSD) curves            │
│ corresponding to aLIGO at O3 sensitivity, Design sensitivity, or A+          │
│ sensitivity~\citep{2020LRR....23....3A}; the optimal SNR corresponds to a    │
│ face-on, directly-overhead source. We then calculate the SNR $\rho$ for a    │
│ random sky position and orientation by generating angular factors $0 < w <   │
│ 1$ from a single-detector antenna pattern~\citep{1993PhRvD..47.2198F} and    │
│ set $\rho = w\rho_\text{opt}$. If $\rho > \rho_\mathrm{thresh}$ for a given  │
│ detector noise curve, we consider the simulated source to be detected.       │
│                                                                              │
│ Finally, we estimate $\xi(\Lambda)$ with a Monte Carlo integral over         │
│ simulated sources. We draw simulated sources with $m_1, m_2, z$ according to │
│ $p_\mathrm{draw}(\theta)$ until injection sets of ~10,000 events are         │
│ created. BH ($m_1$) are drawn from a power law with $M_\text{BH} = 1.5       │
│ M_\odot$. NS ($m_2$) are drawn from a uniform distribution between $1$ and   │
│ $3.5 M_\odot$. Redshifts $z$ are drawn uniform in comoving volume and        │
│ source-frame time. Each simulated system is labeled as detected or not based │
│ on its SNR, described above. We then approximate the integral $\xi(\Lambda)$ │
│ as a sum over $M_\mathrm{det}$ detected simulated systems:                   │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} \xi(\Lambda) \simeq \frac{1}{N_\text{draw}}                 │
│ \sum_{j=1}^{M_\text{det}} \frac{\pi(m_{1,j}, m_{2,j},                        │
│ z_j|\Lambda)}{p_\text{draw}(m_{1,j}, m_{2,j}, z_j)} \end{equation}           │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsection{Gravitational Wave Data and Simulations}                         │
│ \subsubsection{Well-Measured Parameters} While the population distributions  │
│ in \ref{models} are defined in terms of $m_1$, $m_2$, $a_1$, and $a_2$,      │
│ gravitational-wave detectors are most sensitive to degenerate combinations   │
│ of these parameters. These include the gravitational chirp mass              │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} \mathcal{M} = \frac{(m_1 m_2)^{3/5}}{(m_1 + m_2)^{1/5}},    │
│ \end{equation} the symmetric mass ratio \begin{equation} \nu =               │
│ \frac{q}{(1+q)^2}, \end{equation} and $\chi_{\text{eff}}$, a mass-weighted   │
│ sum of the component spins that is approximately conserved during the        │
│ inspiral \begin{equation} \chi_{\text{eff}} = \frac{m_1 a_{1,z} + m_2        │
│ a_{2,z}}{m_1 + m_2} \end{equation} where $a_{1,z}$ and $a_{2,z}$ are the     │

│ -0.1293\psi_3/\rho$, where we draw the SNR $\rho$ according to $p(\rho)      │
│ \propto \rho^{-4}$, an approximation to the SNR distribution of a            │
│ uniform-in-comoving-volume distribution of                                   │
│ sources~\citep{2014arXiv1409.0522C}. We then sample $m_1$, $m_2$, $a_{1,z}$, │
│ and $a_{2,z}$ from the $\psi_0$, $\psi_2$, $\psi_3$ likelihoods, accounting  │
│ for the priors induced by the change of variables by calculating the         │

│ In our population inference, we consider up to four LIGO--Virgo triggers as  │
│ NSBH detections:\ For GW200105 and GW200115, we use the                      │
│ Combined\textunderscore PHM\textunderscore high\textunderscore spin"         │
│ parameter estimation samples from~\citet{2021ApJ...915L...5A}. For GW190426, │
│ we use theIMRPhenomNSBH" samples from~\citet{2021PhRvX..11b1053A}, and for   │
│ GW190814, we use IMRPhenomPv3HM" from~\citet{2020ApJ...896L..44A}}. The      │
│ default LIGO parameter estimation prior $\pi_\mathrm{PE}(\theta)$ is flat in │
│ component spin magnitudes and isotropic in spin tilts, following theU + I"   │
│ spin prior. Meanwhile, the spin models ZS" andZS + AS" described in          │
│ Section~\ref{spin models} assume that the BH is nonspinning ($a_1 = 0$), and │
│ ZS + AS" further assumes that the NS spin is perfectly aligned. In these     │
│ models, we follow \citet{2020ApJ...895L..28M} and estimate $a_2 =            │
│ |a_{2,z}/\text{cos(tilt$_2$)}|$ using the $\chi_\text{eff}$ posterior,       │
│ accounting for the original $\chi_\text{eff}$                                │
│ prior~\citep{2021arXiv210409508C}. To illustrate the effect of the different │
│ spin assumptions on the inferred parameters of each NSBH event, we reweight  │
│ the original parameter estimation posteriors by the three spin priors (the   │
│ defaultZS", as well as ZS + AS" andU + I") with $\beta_s = 0$. The $m_1,     │
│ m_2$ posteriors for the four NSBH events under these three spin models are   │
│ shown in Figure \ref{fig:ligom1m2}. \reply{Analyses were performed on an     │
│ initial set of 4 GW NSBH events from~\citet{2021PhRvX..11b1053A} and         │
│ \citet{2021ApJ...915L...5A}, which were available at the start of this       │
│ work}. During the course of this work, the latest LIGO--Virgo catalog GWTC-3 │
│ was released, which also includes the low-significance NSBH candidates       │
│ GW190917_114630, GW191219_163120,                                            │
│ GW200210_092254~\citep{2021arXiv211103606T,ligo_scientific_collaboration_and │
│ _virgo_2021_5546663}; the inferred masses of these sources under the default │
│ priors are also shown in Figure \ref{fig:ligom1m2}. \reply{A similar full    │
│ analysis could be applied to this larger sample of NSBH events, but we find  │
│ only a slight shift in inferred values of $M_\text{TOV}$ and $M_\text{BH}$   │
│ with the addition of the 3 GWTC-3 events.} In general, the U+I" model        │
│ produces the broadest posteriors, whileZS + AS" provides the tightest        │
│ constraints and the default ZS" model is in the middle. In theZS" and ``ZS + │
│ AS" model, we see that fixing the BH spin to zero tends to increase the      │
│ support for lower $m_2$ and higher $m_1$ because of the anti-correlation     │
│ between $q = m_2/m_1$ and $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$, bringing both components out  │
│ of the putative mass gap~\citep{2021arXiv210914759M}. Because the secondary  │
│ spin is poorly measured, $a_2$ is poorly constrained and essentially         │
│ recovers the broad prior (Figure~\ref{fig:ligoa2}).                          │
│                                                                              │
│ When fitting the population models, we divide the NSBH events into four      │
│ different sets: confident'', with just GW200115 and GW200105;all'', with all │
│ four potential NSBH triggers; and excluding GW190814 and GW190426 one at a   │
│ time each. For each event set, we repeat the population inference using the  │
│ three different spin priors -- U+I",ZS", and ZS + AS" -- and three different │
│ NS mass models in Section \ref{ns models} -- uniform, 1-component (1C), and  │
│ 2-component (2C). Finally, we also vary the pairing function between         │
│ $\beta=3$ (preference for equal masses) and $\beta=0$ (random pairing). In   │
│ total, we consider 72 model/dataset variations. Unless stated otherwise,     │
│ results refer to theZS" spin prior, a 1-component mass function, and random  │
│ pairing ($\beta = 0$). \subsection{Population Properties}                    │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsubsection{$M_\text{TOV}$, $M_\text{BH}$, and the Mass Gap} For each     │
│ model and dataset variation, we infer the minimum BH mass $M_\text{BH}$, the │
│ NS $M_\text{TOV}$, and their difference (representing the width of the mass  │
│ gap), marginalizing over all other parameters of the mass and spin           │
│ distribution. Results for our \emph{Default} model are shown in              │
│ Figs.~\ref{fig:tov_spin}-\ref{fig:fullcorner}, with                          │
│ Fig.-\ref{fig:fullcorner} showing a corner plot over all model parameters.\  │
│                                                                              │
│ {\bf Maximum (spin-dependent) NS mass}: As discussed in \ref{ns models}, at  │
│ a given secondary spin, we model a hard cut-off in the NS mass distribution  │
│ $p(m_2)$. However, in the 1-component and 2-component models, some values of │
│ $\mu$ and $\sigma$ taper off the mass distribution between 2--3 $M_\odot$,   │
│ making it difficult to discern a sharp truncation mass $M_\text{TOV}$ from   │
│ the function's normal behavior. This results in long, flat tails to large    │
│ posterior values of $M_\text{TOV}$ (see panel (a) of                         │
│ Fig.~\ref{fig:tov_spin}), \reply{reaching the prior bounds even if priors on │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ are widened}. A better measured parameter is the 99th         │
│ percentile of the nonspinning NS mass distribution, $M_{99}$ (panel b of     │
│ Fig.~\ref{fig:tov_spin}). For models where the $M_\text{TOV}$ cutoff is      │
│ significant, the 99th percentile is essentially identical to $M_\text{TOV}$. │
│ For models producing a softer cutoff without significant $M_\text{TOV}$      │
│ truncation, the 99th percentile still captures the largest NS we expect to   │
│ observe, and, unlike $M_\text{TOV}$, the inference of $M_{99}$ is consistent │
│ between the three NS mass models.                                            │
│                                                                              │
│ For models including GW190814, we generally infer $M_{99}$ between           │
│ $[NUMERICAL_RESULT]-[NUMERICAL_RESULT],M_\odot$, with lower limits (95%      │
│ credibility) of [NUMERICAL_RESULT]-[NUMERICAL_RESULT] $M_\odot$. Our default │
│ model (all 4 events, $\beta = 0$, ``ZS" spin prior) measures $M_{99} =       │
│ [NUMERICAL_RESULT]^{+[NUMERICAL_RESULT]}{-[NUMERICAL_RESULT]},M\odot$ (68%   │
│ credibility); \reply{the inclusion of 3 additional GWTC-3 events shifts      │
│ $M_\text{99}$ to                                                             │
│ $[NUMERICAL_RESULT]^{+[NUMERICAL_RESULT]}{-[NUMERICAL_RESULT]},M\odot$}. The │
│ cutoff mass is set by GW190814, where $m_2$ is extremely well-constrained.   │
│ Without GW190814, we estimate $M_\text{TOV}$ between                         │
│ $[NUMERICAL_RESULT]--[NUMERICAL_RESULT],M_\odot$, with lower limit (95%      │
│ credibility) of [NUMERICAL_RESULT]-[NUMERICAL_RESULT] $M_\odot$. Without     │
│ GW190814, our estimates are consistent with other estimates of               │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ from gravitational-wave NS observations that do not consider  │
│ spin.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ The spin distribution affects the inferred value of $M_\text{TOV}$ and       │
│ $M_\text{99}$. For all four events, $m_2$ is consistent with being both      │
│ non-spinning ($a_2 = 0$) or maximally spinning ($a_2 = 0.7$, $a/a_\text{Kep} │
│ = 1$). When the spin distribution allows or favors maximally spinning NS,    │
│ lower values of $M_\text{TOV}$ are allowed and can still account for         │
│ GW190814, the most massive secondary. When the spin distribution disfavors   │
│ high spins, the spin-dependent maximum mass is lower and $M_\text{TOV}$ must │
│ be higher in order to accommodate GW190814.                                  │
│                                                                              │
│ This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tov_spin}; the posterior on $M_\text{TOV}$  │
│ inferred under a uniform spin distribution ($\beta_\text{s} = 0$,            │
│ $a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep} = 1$), which has support at high NS spins, has a  │
│ significant tail to lower values below [NUMERICAL_RESULT],M_\odot (dashed    │
│ blue curve). A prior that requires GW190814 to be maximally spinning         │
│ ($a_\text{min}/a_\text{Kep} = 0.9$) brings $M_\text{TOV}$ estimates even     │
│ lower, to [NUMERICAL_RESULT] $M_\odot$, with support below                   │
│ [NUMERICAL_RESULT],M_\odot (green dashed curve in Fig. \ref{fig:tov_spin}).  │
│ Meanwhile, requiring all NSs to be nonspinning ($a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep} = │
│ 0$) means that GW190814's secondary (if it is a NS) sets the non-spinning    │
│ maximum mass for the population, and results in a narrower posterior         │
│ preferring larger values. The difference between posteriors on               │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ and $M_\text{99}$ modeled with GW190814 (black solid, red     │
│ dotted, blue dashed) and without GW90814 (solid yellow curve) is bridged     │
│ partially by models assuming GW190814's spin is near-maximal. This effect is │
│ also visible in Fig. \ref{fig:traces}; if GW190814 is assumed spinning, the  │
│ upper end of $p(m_2)$ visibly shifts to lower masses, and zero-spin NS mass  │
│ functions truncating below GW190814's secondary's mass are allowed (see      │
│ overplotted credible interval). We see that even in the absence of           │
│ well-constrained $a_2$, modeling a spin-dependent maximum mass has           │
│ significant effects on the inferred NS mass distribution.                    │
│                                                                              │
│ \textbf{GW190814's secondary spin}: Using the posterior on $M_\text{TOV}$    │
│ (Fig. \ref{fig:tov_spin}) inferred from the population of NSBHs excluding    │
│ GW190814, we can infer the minimum secondary spin of GW190814 required for   │
│ it to be consistent with the NSBH population. Results are shown in panel (a) │
│ of Fig. \ref{fig:gw190814_spin}. For our sample of NSBH events excluding     │
│ GW190814, the results are inconclusive: because the posterior on             │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ is broad, GW190814 is consistent even if non-spinning (with   │
│ the minimum required $a_2/a_\text{Kep} = 0$), but it may also be maximally   │
│ spinning with $a_2/a_\mathrm{Kep} = 1$. GW190814 may also be an outlier from │
│ the NSBH population, even if it is maximally spinning: for this figure, we   │
│ allow min $a_2/a_\text{Kep} > 1$, but $a_2/a_\text{Kep} > 1$ would imply     │
│ inconsistency with the rest of the population as $a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep}  │
│ = 1$. Future GW observations of a larger population of NSBH events (see      │
│ panel (b) of Fig. \ref{fig:gw190814_spin}) could allow a much tighter        │
│ measurement of GW190814's secondary spin.                                    │

│ {\bf Minimum BH mass}: Across all models, the inferred BH minimum mass       │
│ $M_\text{BH}$ is between 4--7 $M_\odot$ with typical uncertainties of $\pm 1 │
│ M_\odot$. Our default model using the ZS" spin model, all 4 NSBH events      │
│ (GW190814, GW190426, GW200105, GW200115), and random pairing ($\beta = 0$)   │
│ results in $M_\mathrm{BH} = [NUMERICAL_RESULT]\,M_\odot$ (68\% credibility). │
│ At the low end, we infer $M_\text{BH} = 4.2^{+ 1.1}_{-1.0}\,M_\odot$ using   │
│ all 4 NSBH events, a uniform NS mass distribution, pairing function          │
│ $\beta=3$, and theU+I" spin model. At the high end, we infer $M_\text{BH} =  │
│ 6.7^{+ 0.4}{-0.8},M\odot$ (68% credibility) using only the confident NSBH    │
│ events and the spin model. The effect of the $m_1, m_2$ pairing function     │

│ {\bf Mass gap}: We estimate the inferred width of the lower mass gap as the  │
│ difference between the minimum BH mass, $M_\text{BH}$, and the maximum       │
│ nonspinning NS mass, $M_\text{TOV}$ or $M_{99}$. \reply{The mass gap's width │

│ from 2-7 $M_\odot$}. As seen in Figures \ref{fig:tov_spin} and               │
│ \ref{fig:mbh}; the overlap between the posteriors on $M_\text{BH}$ and       │
│ $M_\text{99}$ is low, suggesting the existence of a mass gap. Similarly,     │
│ panels (a) and (b) in Figure \ref{fig:ppd} show inferred ($m_1, m_2$)        │
│ posterior predictive distributions, overplotted with the LVK $m_1, m_2$      │
│ posteriors. As Fig. \ref{fig:ppd} illustrates, {for all model variations we  │
│ find evidence for a separation between the upper end of the NS mass          │
│ distribution and the lower end of the BH mass distribution}.                 │
│                                                                              │
│ For our default model, we measure a mass gap of $2.5^{+0.8}{-1.0} M\odot$    │
│ \reply{($2.3^{+0.7}{-1.0} M\odot$ with 3 additional GWTC-3 events)}, wider   │
│ than $0,M_\odot$ with [NUMERICAL_RESULT] credibility and $1,M_\odot$ with    │
│ 90% credibility. The inferred mass gap is widest when only using the         │
│ confident NSBH events, between $3.0$–$4.5,M_\odot$, and narrowest when using │
│ all 4 NSBH events, between $1.5$–$3.0,M_\odot$. This is because the mass gap │
│ is narrowed from the NS side by the inclusion of GW190814, and from the BH   │
│ side by the inclusion of GW190426 (see Figure \ref{fig:ligom1m2}. All model  │
│ variations (spin prior, $\beta$, events) support for the existence of a mass │
│ gap: $>0,M_\odot$ with 92% or higher (up to $>99.9$%) credibility, and $>1   │
│ M_\odot$ with 68% or higher (up to $>99.9$%) credibility.                    │
│                                                                              │
│ As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:ligom1m2}, additional spin assumptions (namely      │
│ assuming that the BH is nonspinning and/or the NS spin is aligned) tend to   │
│ prefer lower $m_2$ and higher $m_1$, which widens the inferred mass gap.     │
│                                                                              │
│ When using spin priors in which the BH is assumed to be nonspinning, even    │

│                                                                              │
│ \subsubsection{Mass and spin distributions} In addition to the most          │
│ astrophysically relevant parameters -- $M_\text{BH}$, $M_\text{TOV}$, and    │
│ the width of the mass gap -- we also constrain other parameters of the       │
│ primary and secondary mass functions. In this section, we discuss general    │
│ trends in the mass distribution shape, as inferred from posterior traces     │
│ (Figure \ref{fig:traces}).                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ We first consider the NS mass distribution, $p(m_2)$, which differs slightly │
│ depending on the mass model used. For the 1-component model, we generally    │
│ infer a broad distribution ($\sigma \simeq 0.5$) with mean $\mu$ between     │
│ $1.2$ and $1.6 M_\odot$. A broad distribution is especially necessary to     │
│ explain the large secondary mass of GW190814. The 2-component model          │
│ generally agrees well with the 1-component model, although additional        │
│ substructure (see panel (a) of Fig. \ref{fig:traces}), particularly a        │
│ narrower peak at around 1.3 $M_\odot$ and a longer tail to high NS masses    │
│ (above $2 M_\odot$) is possible. The only free parameter in the uniform      │
│ model is the cutoff mass $M_\text{TOV}$. Though the flatness of the uniform  │
│ model means we necessarily infer higher probability at masses near           │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$, $M_\text{TOV}$ is generally consistent with the upper limit  │
│ (99th percentile $M_{99}$) inferred from other mass models.                  │
│                                                                              │
│ The BH mass function is consistent between the three NS mass models. The     │
│ most significant influence is the pairing function ($\beta = 0$ for random   │
│ or $\beta = 3$ for equal-mass preference). For example, under our default    │
│ model \reply{(4 events)}, which includes random pairing ($\beta = 0$), we    │
│ infer a distribution with power-law slope $\alpha_\text{BH} =                │
│ 3.4^{+1.4}{-0.9}$ \reply{($\alpha\text{BH} = 2.3^{+7}{-1.0}$ with all 7      │
│ events)}. Under the same assumptions but preferring equal masses, $\beta =   │
│ 3$, the inferred distribution shifts to significantly shallower slopes,      │
│ $\alpha\text{BH} = [NUMERICAL_RESULT]$. This is because the preference for   │
│ equal-mass pairing requires a shallower slope in order to account for        │
│ higher-mass black holes, especially the primary of GW190814.                 │
│                                                                              │
│ As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fullcorner}, the joint posterior on                 │
│ $\beta_\text{spin}$ and $a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep}$ prefers low              │
│ $a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep}$ and high $\beta_\text{spin}$, but mainly         │
│ recovers the flat prior, which inherently prefers steeper and smaller spin   │
│ distributions. Thus our measurement of the NS spin distribution is mostly    │
│ uninformative, with a very mild preference for small spins.                  │
│                                                                              │

│ In this section, we study measurements of NS and BH population properties    │
│ from future observations. For our simulations, we use a fiducial set of      │
│ parameters. We consider the three NS mass models. For the uniform NS mass    │
│ distribution, we take $M_\text{TOV} = 2,M_\odot$ or $2.2,M_\odot$. For the   │
│ 1-component distribution, we take $\mu = 1.5$ and $\sigma = 0.5$. For the    │
│ 2-component distribution, based on \cite{2020PhRvD.102f4063C}, we take $     │
│ \mathcal{A}=0.63$, $\mu_1 = 1.35$, $\sigma_1 = 0.07$, $\mu_2 = 1.85$, and    │
│ $\sigma_2 = 0.35$. We truncate the 1- and 2-component mass distributions at  │
│ the maximum NS mass given by $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ and the NS spin. For the BH    │
│ distribution, we take $\alpha = 2$, and consider three examples of a lower   │
│ mass gap for each $M_\text{TOV}$ value: no mass gap ($M_\text{BH} =          │
│ M_\text{TOV}$); a narrow mass gap where $M_\text{BH} =                       │
│ M_\text{crit}(a/a_\text{Kep} = 1)$ ($2.41,M_\odot$ for $M_\text{TOV} =       │
│ 2,M_\odot$, $2.65,M_\odot$ for $M_\text{TOV} = 2.2,M_\odot$); and a wide     │
│ mass gap with $M_\text{BH} = 5,M_\odot$. For the pairing function, we take   │
│ $\beta = 3$. We use the ZS + AS" spin model and work with three different    │
│ values of $\beta_s$ and $a_\mathrm{max}$: a uniform distribution with        │
│ $\beta_s = 0$ and $a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep} = 1$ (uniform" spin) or         │
│ $a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep} = 0.5$ (medium" spin), and $\beta_s = 2$ with     │
│ $a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep} = 1$ (low" spin). We simulate observations for    │
│ LIGO at Design and A+ sensitivity. In total, we consider 3 NS models x 2     │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ values x 3 spin models x 2 detector sensitivities = 36        │
│ variations.                                                                  │

│ Assuming GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population,    │
│ NSBH are expected to merge at a rate of $45^{+75}{-33} \text{Gpc}^{-3}       │
│ \text{yr}^{-1}$ (90% credibility) \citep{2021ApJ...915L...5A}, resulting in  │
│ between 2-20 NSBH/year at Design sensitivity and 8-80 NSBH/year during A+.   │
│ Assuming a broader component mass distribution produces rate estimates from  │
│ LVK observations of $130^{+112}{-69} \text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{yr}^{-1}$, for    │
│ detection rates of 8-30 NSBH/year at Design sensitivity and 40-160 NSBH/year │
│ during A+. Accordingly, we simulate constraints for future datasets of 10,   │
│ 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, and 150 NSBH detections, and explore how key    │
│ parameters converge.                                                         │

│                                                                              │
│ For the 1-component population model and $M_\text{TOV} = 2,M_\odot$,         │
│ marginalizing over uncertainty in the underlying spin distribution           │
│ ($\beta_\text{s}$ and $a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep}$), 10 NSBH detections allow │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ to be constrained to $2.0^{+0.15}{-0.08},M\odot$, or          │
│ $2.2^{+0.19}{-0.07},M\odot$ for $M_\text{TOV} = 2.2$, with the lower limit   │
│ on $M_\text{TOV}$ generally much tighter than the upper limit. In our        │
│ models, 50 NSBH detections allows constraints of $\pm 0.05$, and determining │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ within $\pm 0.02$ is achievable with 150 events.              │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ is also slightly better measured for distributions favoring   │
│ lower spin; the medium" andlow" spin distributions allow constraints down to │
│ $\pm 0.03$ for 50 events and $\pm 0.01$ for 150. Constraints on              │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ generally scale as $N^{-0.5}$; the exact convergence depends  │
│ on how well the drop-off in events can be resolved given the mass function   │
│ and $M_\text{TOV}$ value. Compared to constraints from a 1-component         │
│ population, $M_\text{TOV}$ converges fastest for lower values of             │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$. Convergence is also fastest for a uniform mass distribution. │
│ This is expected, as both of these variations produce the most events close  │
│ to $M_\text{TOV}$.                                                           │
│                                                                              │

│ We find that $M_\text{TOV}$ and $M_\text{BH}$ can be measured virtually      │
│ independently, under the optimistic assumption that all BH and NS can be     │
│ confidently identified (see Section \ref{sec:conclusion}). As a result, all  │
│ three mass gap widths (wide, $M_\text{BH} = 5 M_\odot$; narrow, $M_\text{BH} │
│ = M_\text{crit}(M_\text{TOV}, a/a_\text{Kep} = 1)$; none, $M_\text{BH} =     │
│ M_\text{TOV}$) can be resolved by modeling a population of spinning NSBH     │
│ binaries.                                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ For the ``no mass gap" case of $M_\text{BH} = M_\text{TOV} = 2,M_\odot$, 10  │
│ events constrain the mass gap width to $0.0^{+0.07}{-0.15} M\odot$. In       │
│ general, the lower bound on the mass gap width is more uncertain given the   │
│ extended tails to high $M_\text{TOV}$ and low $M_\text{BH}$ seen on          │
│ posteriors (see Figs. \ref{fig:tov_spin}, \ref{fig:mbh},                     │
│ \ref{fig:fullcorner}). 50 events allow measurements within $0.00 \pm 0.02    │
│ M_\odot$, and 150 events can measure the width of the mass gap as precisely  │
│ as $\pm 0.01 M_\odot$. For a wider mass gap, with $M_\text{TOV} = 2,M_\odot$ │
│ and $M_\text{BH} = 5,M_\odot$, 50 NSBH events can measure the mass gap width │
│ to $3.00 [NUMERICAL_RESULT] M_\odot$, and [NUMERICAL_RESULT] M_\odot can be  │
│ achieved with 150 events. \reply{This is primarily because a wider mass gap  │
│ is achieved with a larger value of $M_\text{BH}$, which thus has a           │
│ proportionally higher uncertainty, leading to wider credible intervals for   │
│ wider mass gaps.} In general, assuming sharp gap edges, the width of the     │
│ mass gap converges as $N^{-1}$. Factors that lead to sharper constraints on  │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$ or $M_\text{BH}$, such as a smaller value of $M_\text{TOV}$,  │
│ a spin distribution favoring low $a_2$, or a steeper BH slope $\alpha$,      │
│ unsurprisingly also result in faster convergence for the mass gap width.     │
│ Example posteriors (for multiple input parameter variations) on              │
│ $M_\text{BH}$ and $M_\text{TOV}$, from which the mass gap width is           │
│ calculated, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:simulated_massgap}.                   │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsection{Bias from Assuming Neutron Stars Are Non-Spinning}               │
│                                                                              │
│ A handful of events are still expected above the nonspinning maximum NS mass │
│ thanks to the effects of rotation support. For a uniform" spin distribution, │
│ allowing maximally spinning NS, and $M_\text{TOV} = 2\,M_\odot$, around 5\%  │
│ of our simulated 2-component mass function will have rotation support        │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$. 6\% of the 1-component mass function, and up to 10\% of the  │
│ uniform mass function, will show evidence of rotation support above the      │
│ maximum mass. For $M_\text{TOV} = 2.2\,M_\odot$, this drops to around 2\%,   │
│ 3\%, and 8\% respectively. For $M_\text{TOV} = 2\,M_\odot$ and thelow" spin  │
│ distribution, which strongly disfavors maximally spinning NS, just 1%, 2%,   │
│ and 3% of the population show this behavior. These events can be seen in     │
│ Fig. \ref{fig:distributions}, with masses greater than the red line marking  │
│ $M_\text{TOV}$. If a population contains these events, where the most        │
│ massive neutron star is measured above the true nonspinning $M_\text{TOV}$,  │
│ then in order to accurately estimate $M_\text{TOV}$ this rotation support    │
│ must be properly modeled. If NSs are wrongly assumed to be nonspinning,      │
│ estimates of $M_\text{TOV}$ will be biased.                                  │
│                                                                              │
│ For an underlying uniform" spin distribution, if all NSs are assumed to be   │
│ nonspinning, it can take as few as 10--20 events to wrongly exclude the true │
│ value of $M_\text{TOV}$ with 99.7\% credibility. At 50--150 events, the      │
│ lower bound of the 99.7\% credibility interval can be as much as 0.2-0.3     │
│ $M_\odot$ above $M_\text{TOV}$, with the true value excluded entirely. On    │
│ the other hand, if spins are relatively low, the bias from neglecting the    │
│ spin-dependent maximum mass is smaller, but still often present. For thelow" │
│ ($\beta_\text{spin} = 2, a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep} = 1)$ and medium" spin    │
│ distributions ($\beta_\text{spin} = 0, a_\text{max}/a_\text{Kep} = 0.5)$,    │
│ which disfavor and disallow large spins, respectively, it usually takes      │
│ 30--90 events to exclude the correct $M_\text{TOV}$ at 99.7\% credibility.   │
│ This is partially because even substantial NS spins may have a relatively    │
│ small effect on $M_\text{crit}$; for a NS with $a_2/a_\text{Kep} = 0.5$,     │
│ $M_\text{crit}$ is just $1.037 M_\text{TOV}$, a change of less than 4\%. If  │
│ spins and masses are low enough compared to $M_\text{TOV}$, it is possible   │
│ to reach ~hundreds of NSBH detections without seeing substantial bias.       │
│ However, the exact amount of bias depends heavily on the number of massive   │
│ spinning neutron stars in the observed population, which is unknown. The     │
│ difference in convergence between spin distributions for a specific          │
│ realization of events is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:bias}.  \subsection{Inferring │
│ the Relation Between Maximum NS Mass and Spin} \label{sec:spinmass} In       │
│ previous sections, we consider theuniversal relation" between the spin and   │
│ critical mass as reported by \citet{2020MNRAS.499L..82M}. However, this may  │
│ only hold for certain families of equations of state. As a result, measuring │
│ the relationship between $M_{\text{crit}}$ and $a/a_\text{Kep}$ as a         │
│ high-degree polynomial may provide insights into the nuclear physics that    │
│ informs $M_\text{TOV}$ and rotation-supported neutron stars. We consider the │
│ simplest case, a linear dependence between spin and maximum mass, with       │
│ first-order coefficient $A_1$:                                               │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} M_{\text{crit}}(a_2, a_{\text{Kep}}, M_{\text{TOV}}) =      │
│ M_{\text{TOV}} A_1(\frac{a_2}{a_{\text{Kep}}}) \end{equation} and infer      │
│ $A_1$ jointly with other population parameters.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ We consider models with $A_1 = 0.2$ and $0.4$. For a population with a       │
│ uniform NS spin distribution up to $a_\mathrm{Kep}$ and $A_1 = 0.2$, 10      │
│ events can constrain $A_1$ to around $0.2^{+0.2}{-0.1}$, around              │
│ [NUMERICAL_RESULT] for 50 events, and around [NUMERICAL_RESULT] for 150      │
│ events, assuming a known spin distribution. Generally, posteriors on $A_1$   │
│ are better constrained at low values, as a minimum amount of rotation        │
│ support above $M\text{TOV}$ is necessary to explain observations of          │
│ extra-massive neutron stars. Constraints on $A_1$ converge as $N^{-0.5}$.    │
│ Given that constraining $A_1$ requires measuring a number of NS with mass    │
│ greater than $M_\text{TOV}$, populations with medium" orlow" spin            │
│ distributions constrain $A_1$ much more weakly, as do populations with fewer │
│ events close to $M_\text{TOV}$ (i.e. for larger values of $M_\text{TOV}$).   │
│ For both the medium" andlow" spin distributions, 50 events can constrain     │
│ $A_1$ to $\pm 0.1$, or $\pm 0.06$ for 150 events. $A_1$ is also covariant    │
│ with $M_\text{TOV}$, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:slope}. A lower value │
│ of $M_\text{TOV}$ with a higher $A_1$, and a higher value of $M_\text{TOV}$  │
│ with a lower $A_1$, can account for the high masses of rotation-supported    │
│ neutron stars equally well.                                                  │

│ \section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion} We considered the impact of a    │
│ spin-dependent maximum NS mass on measurements of the mass gap and maximum   │
│ NS mass from NSBH observations. Our main conclusions are as follows: In our  │
│ analysis and projections for the future, we have made several simplifying    │
│ assumptions. In order to focus only on the NSBH section of the compact       │
│ binary mass distribution, we have assumed that NSBH systems can be           │
│ confidently distinguished from BBH systems, \reply{and implemented models    │
│ using definite source classifications for events}. In reality, the           │
│ classification of events is uncertain, especially without prior knowledge of │
│ the mass distribution. Future population analyses should jointly model the   │
│ entire compact binary mass distribution as                                   │
│ in\reply{~\citet{2017MNRAS.465.3254M,2020ApJ...899L...8F,2021arXiv211103498F │
│ }, and \citet{2019MNRAS.488.3810P}, as well as the compact binary spin       │
│ distribution and neutron star matter effects, while simultaneously inferring │
│ source classification}. \reply{In this work, rather than marginalizing over  │
│ the uncertain source classification, we analyze all events with $m_2 <       │
│ 3,M_\odot$ and $m_1 > 3,M_\odot$ as NSBHs, and illustrate the effect of      │
│ different assumptions about source identities by repeating the inference     │
│ with and without GW190814}. Since NSs are expected to follow a different     │
│ spin distribution from BHs, the population-level spin distributions may      │
│ provide another clue to distinguish NSs and BHs in merging binaries, in      │
│ addition to masses and any tidal                                             │
│ information~\citep{2020arXiv200101747W,2021arXiv210615745G}. We have also    │
│ assumed that the astrophysical NS mass distribution cuts off at the maximum  │
│ possible mass set by nuclear physics. In reality, even if there is a mass    │
│ gap between NS and BH, the lower edge of the mass gap may be either above or │
│ below the non-spinning NS maximum mass $M$. In the future, it would be       │
│ useful to incorporate external knowledge of the NS EOS, particularly to      │
│ compare the inferred location of the lower mass gap edge against external    │
│ $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ constraints.                                                │

│ Follow the paper's methodology and the instructions precisely to reproduce   │
│ the specified result. Remember to save results and code to permanent files,  │
│ as your code execution environment is ephemeral. Comment your code clearly   │
│ and make explicit note of all of your thoughts or decisions. Make sure to    │
│ handle all data loading, processing, and computation steps necessary for the │
│ task. Do not give up until you have made a solid effort at reproducing the   │
│ results! You must execute code using your given tools, not just produce a    │
│ plan.                                                                        │

│ Please remember the following important tips about tool usage:               │
│                                                                              │
│  • The execute_python tool is ephemeral, so any variables or states will not │
│    be saved. You must save your work to files for persistence.               │
│  • Do not use the timeout parameter with the execute_python tool             │
│  • Always use ABSOLUTE paths. Use pwd in your home (starting) directory to   │
│    get your absolute path. This is where you should write files. Example (if │
│    pwd shows /tmp/tmp123456): { "command": "create", "path":                 │
│    "/tmp/tmp123456/filename.py", "file_text": "# Your code here" }           │
│                                                                              │
│ Remember, this is a test of the paper's reproducibility. This means you      │
│ should implement the paper's methodology from scratch on your own. Many      │
│ tasks will involve significant challenges, computational complexity, code    │
│ implementation, and trial and error. This is an extremely difficult task,    │
│ but is extremely important for the future of scientific research.            │
