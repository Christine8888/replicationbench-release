╭─ System ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ You are an expert astrophysicist tasked with reproducing the key results of  │
│ a scientific research paper. Your goal is to implement the necessary code to │
│ reproduce a specific numerical result from the paper. Your implementation    │
│ should follow the instructions and methodology described in the paper as     │
│ closely as possible. Your implementation should also be well-structured and  │
│ documented. Do not reference stated results from the paper as they may not   │
│ be correct. All results must be computed by the code you write. Work         │
│ efficiently and complete your task in the allotted time.                     │
│                                                                              │
│ CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS: 0. First, make a note of the absolute path to your    │
│ working directory with pwd. You may only work in this directory.             │
│                                                                              │
│  1 You MUST NOT hardcode numerical values from the paper's results as your   │
│    answers.                                                                  │
│  2 You MUST actually compute the results from scratch using proper data      │
│    analysis techniques. Any provided data is fair game for use in your       │
│    computation.                                                              │
│  3 DO NOT EVER fall back on values quoted from the paper as your answers     │
│    (That is cheating!).                                                      │
│  4 If you encounter dependency or installation issues, you must troubleshoot │
│    them rather than bypass the computation by looking up the answer.         │
│  5 If you absolutely cannot install a required package after multiple        │
│    attempts, clearly state this limitation and implement an alternative      │
│    approach that still performs real computation.                            │
│  6 Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you guess any answers. If you cannot        │
│    compute the answer, return None for that result.                          │
│  7 You may use open-source libraries, but DO NOT download the paper's        │
│    original source code.                                                     │
│                                                                              │
│ FAILURE HANDLING: If you fail to compute a result after multiple attempts,   │
│ you MUST return None (or a list/array of Nones matching the expected output  │
│ format). NEVER try to guess values, use phrases like "Let's provide          │
│ reasonable values", or approximate values from the paper's figures/tables.   │
│ Simply state that you failed and return None.                                │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:                                            │
│                                                                              │
│  1 DO NOT assume any variables or state from previous calls are preserved.   │
│    EACH call to a Python tool or Bash command is independent and you must    │
│    re-import all necessary packages and redefine all necessary variables.    │
│    You should use good code organization and frequently save code and        │
│    intermediate results to files. You may do this either via the Python tool │
│    or the execute_bash tool.                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ You have ample computational resources and execution time. Do not assume you │
│ do not have the resources to compute the task. You should make a best effort │
│ at every task.                                                               │
│                                                                              │
│  2 CODE INTERPRETER STATE:                                                   │
│     • The execute_python tool is only for running Python code directly, not  │
│       executing Python files.                                                │
│     • Both the Python code interpreter (execute_python) and the Bash tool    │
│       (execute_bash) are EPHEMERAL - all variables, imports, and state are   │
│       cleared between each code execution                                    │
│     • Python and bash commands have a timeout of 2 hours, and will be killed │
│       if they exceed this limit.                                             │
│     • To avoid running out of work time due to unexpected errors, you should │
│       wrap every bash command with a timeout command. This will ensure that  │
│       long-running commands are properly terminated, and help you in         │
│       managing your time and execution resources.                            │
│     • For persistent code, you MUST write Python files (.py) and execute     │
│       them                                                                   │
│     • Always save your work to files for reuse - don't rely on variables     │
│       staying in memory between calls                                        │
│     • Example: Instead of defining functions in the interpreter, write them  │
│       to a file like "./analysis.py" and import them                         │
│     • All Python installations should be done using python3 -m pip install   │
│       --user. No other installation methods are allowed.                     │
│     • All file downloads and new file writes should be done in your local    │
│       directory                                                              │
│     • You are encouraged to write all scripts to files, to save script       │
│       outputs to disk, and execute large amounts of code at once.            │
│  3 PATH HANDLING:                                                            │
│     • If you are using a relative path, you must always append "./" to the   │
│       beginning of the path.                                                 │
│     • If you are using an absolute path, you must use the FULL path          │
│     • DO NOT assume or create any other working directory than the one given │
│       by your initial pwd command                                            │
│    Examples of CORRECT path usage:                                           │
│     • Creating a file (relative path): "./utils.py"                          │
│     • Reading data (absolute path): "/workspace/data/observations.csv"       │
│  4 Perform sanity checks on your intermediate calculations. For example:     │
│     • If calculating stellar masses, verify they are within known physical   │
│       ranges (e.g., 0.1-100 solar masses for main sequence stars)            │
│     • If computing distances, ensure they are reasonable for the context     │
│       (e.g., galactic scales vs. cosmological scales)                        │
│     • If calculating velocities, verify they don't exceed the speed of light │
│     • If working with probabilities, ensure they are between 0 and 1 If you  │
│       encounter values that are physically impossible or orders of magnitude │
│       off from expected ranges, stop and investigate your approach.          │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT TOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:                                           │
│                                                                              │
│  1 When using the 'execute_python' tool, you MUST include the 'code'         │
│    parameter. DO NOT use the timeout parameter. This will cause errors.      │
│  2 When using the 'execute_bash' tool, you MUST include the 'cmd' parameter  │
│  3 When using the 'str_replace_editor' tool with 'create' command, you MUST  │
│    include:                                                                  │
│                                                                              │
│  • 'command': "create"                                                       │
│  • 'path': "./filename.py"  # MUST use "./" to indicate the working          │
│    directory                                                                 │
│  • 'file_text': "contents of the file"                                       │
│                                                                              │
│  4 ALL tools that accept paths expect absolute paths and will error with "is │
│    not an absolute path" otherwise. Using these tools incorrectly will       │
│    result in errors and no progress.                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ You will be evaluated both on whether your final numerical or code outputs   │
│ match the expected result, AND whether your scientific reasoning and         │
│ implementation are correct. You will be graded on how faithfully and         │
│ accurately you reproduce the actual steps in the paper, not just the end     │
│ result. Make note of all your reasoning and planning, and summarize your     │
│ work often. Ensure that you are replicating the paper's methodology, not     │
│ just the parts needed for the tasks. The approach you take to solve the      │
│ problem is flexible - use whatever methods, libraries, and code organization │
│ that you believe will most effectively replicate the result.                 │
│                                                                              │
│ SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: When you are finished, you MUST write your final    │
│ answer as a valid JSON dictionary to a file named 'submission.json' in your  │
│ current working directory (the directory shown by pwd at the start).         │
│                                                                              │
│ IMPORTANT: Write submission.json to your LOCAL working directory (e.g.,      │
│ /tmp/something/submission.json).                                             │
│                                                                              │
│ PARTIAL SUBMISSION GUIDANCE:                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│  • You should save your progress FREQUENTLY by updating submission.json      │
│    after completing each task                                                │
│  • Initialize submission.json early with None values for all expected fields │
│  • Update each field as soon as you compute its value                        │
│  • This ensures partial credit if you run out of time or tokens              │
│  • Use None for any results you haven't computed yet or cannot compute       │
│  • Even if you have not successfully computed any result, you should still   │
│    submit a submission.json file with None values for all fields.            │
│  • If you do not produce a submission.json file, you will receive a 0 score. │
│                                                                              │
│ WARNING: You may hit token or time limits. There is no advance warning. Your │
│ scorer will run on whatever is in submission.json when limits are hit, so    │
│ save your progress often!                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ Use None for any results you cannot compute; DO NOT guess any answers that   │
│ you have not written code to compute. Each value in the JSON object should   │
│ have been computed by your code execution, following the instructions in the │
│ paper and task description. You should return float values with full         │
│ precision, as you will be graded on the precision of your results. Do not    │
│ round float values.                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ After writing the FINAL submission.json file with all computed results, call │
│ the submit() tool with a string message (e.g., submit("Task completed")) to  │
│ signal that you have completed the task. Do not include explanations or      │
│ comments alongside the JSON object in the file.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ Example workflow:                                                            │
│                                                                              │
│  1 Initialize submission.json with the expected structure and None values    │
│  2 As you complete each computation, update submission.json with that result │
│  3 Continue until all tasks are done or you approach limits                  │
│  4 Write final results to ./submission.json in your current directory using: │
│     • Python: with open('./submission.json', 'w') as f: json.dump(results,   │
│       f)                                                                     │
│     • Bash: echo '{{"task1"}: 42.156789, "task2": [1.23, 4.56], "task3":     │
│       None}' > submission.json                                               │
│  5 Call submit("Done") to signal completion                                  │

│ needle-in-the-haystack event and the first \emph{Chandra} FXT of its kind.   │
│ Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from     │

│ archives. We introduce new event file representations, $E-t$,Maps and        │
│ $E-t-dt$,Cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral           │
│ information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to        │
│ variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach   │
│ employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative   │
│ features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the      │
│ embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within            │
│ transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbor searches around      │
│ known transients, producing a catalog of 3,559 candidates (3,447 flares and  │
│ 112 dips). XRT,200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability,     │
│ including an intense, hard $<$10,s initial burst, followed by spectral       │
│ softening in an $\sim$800,s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT,200515 as     │

│ in the LMC. Our method extends to datasets from other observatories such as  │

│ \citep{2022ApJ...927..211L} and an X-ray dip associated with the first       │
│ extragalactic planet candidate \citep{2021NatAs...5.1297D}, underscore the   │
│ challenges of identifying such rare events within large X-ray catalogs.      │
│ Beyond magnetar-powered FXTs as the aftermath of binary neutron star mergers │
│ \citep{2006Sci...311.1127D, 2008MNRAS.385.1455M, 2013ApJ...763L..22Z,        │

│ interesting origins of extragalactic FXTs include supernova shock breakouts  │
│ (SBOs) \citep{2008Natur.453..469S, 2009ApJ...702..226M, 2020ApJ...896...39A, │

│ because narrow-field X-ray missions such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory    │
│ (\emph{Chandra}) \citep{2000SPIE.4012....2W}, \emph{XMM-Newton}              │
│ \citep{2001A&A...365L...1J} and \emph{Swift-XRT} \citep{2005SSRv..120..165B} │
│ are not designed as wide time-domain surveys, X-ray transient discoveries    │
│ are often serendipitous. They can be found in observations that were         │
│ originally proposed for a completely unrelated science objective and are     │
│ rarely the target of the observation. In many cases serendipitously found    │
│ X-ray sources do not get characterized or classified, since their transient  │
│ nature is not immediately obvious. Instead, observations with X-ray          │
│ transients often get stored in large data archives and remain unnoticed.     │
│ This raises the need for a systematic search for short-duration phenomena in │
│ high-energy catalogs. New missions such as \emph{eROSITA}                    │
│ \citep{2021A&A...647A...1P}, \emph{Einstein Probe}                           │
│ \citep{2022hxga.book...86Y} and the upcoming \emph{AXIS} Observatory         │
│ \citep{2024SPIE13093E..28R} target X-ray transients more directly, thus the  │
│ development of novel transient detection methods is becoming even more       │
│ relevant. The temporary, unpredictable and unusual' nature of X-ray          │
│ transients distinguishes them fromnormal' X-ray source emissions. From a     │
│ data science perspective, they can be understood as `anomalies' within a     │
│ large dataset. Existing methods for identifying X-ray transients primarily   │
│ rely on statistical tests of variability \citep{2019MNRAS.487.4721Y,         │
│ 2020A&A...640A.124P, quirola2022extragalactic, 2023arXiv230413795Q}. While   │
│ effective within specific constraints, these approaches are inherently       │
│ limited by their underlying assumptions, which may not capture the diverse   │
│ nature of transient phenomena. In contrast, machine learning offers a more   │
│ flexible, expressive, and scalable framework, making it particularly         │
│ well-suited for anomaly detection in large, high-dimensional datasets with   │
│ diverse transient types. While optical time-domain surveys are at the        │
│ forefront of leveraging extensive observational programs, like \emph{ZTF}    │
│ \citep{2019PASP..131a8002B} or the upcoming \emph{LSST} survey               │
│ \citep{2019ApJ...873..111I}, and neural network-based anomaly detection      │
│ tools to identify rare sources among countless ordinary objects              │
│ \citep{2021ApJS..255...24V,2021MNRAS.508.5734M,2022MNRAS.517..393M}, the     │
│ X-ray astronomy community has only recently begun exploring the potential of │
│ machine learning to classify sources \citep{2022ApJ...941..104Y,             │
│ 2024MNRAS.528.4852P} or to search for needle-in-a-haystack events in large   │
│ X-ray datasets and archives \citep{2022A&A...659A..66K, sdthesis}. The       │
│ effectiveness of machine learning methods largely depends on the algorithm's │
│ ability to learn useful representations from the data.                       │
│                                                                              │
│ \emph{Representation learning} \citep{bengio2013representation} is an        │
│ increasingly popular technique in astronomy used in supervised,              │
│ semi-supervised, self-supervised and unsupervised frameworks                 │
│ \citep{2018NatAs...2..151N, 2021ApJ...911L..33H, 2022MNRAS.513.1581W,        │
│ 2024RASTI...3...19S, 2024MNRAS.530.1274M}. It involves creating or learning  │
│ meaningful representations for specific modalities of scientific data, which │
│ can then be used for downstream tasks such as regression, classification,    │
│ or, as in this work, anomaly detection. The compressed representations live  │
│ in a low-dimensional embedding space, in which anomalous data samples are    │
│ well-separated from more ordinary ones.                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ We propose a new unsupervised representation learning method to perform a    │
│ large-scale search for X-ray transients in the \emph{Chandra} archive.       │
│ High-energy catalogs include individual X-ray source observations in the     │
│ form of event files. The variable length of these time series poses a        │
│ challenge in creating consistent representations suitable for transient      │
│ searches with machine learning. Most deep learning algorithms take a         │
│ fixed-length input for all data samples. In order to effectively represent   │
│ event files over a broad range of lengths, we introduce novel fixed-length   │
│ event file representations, which take into account both their time-domain   │
│ and energy-domain information. Applying feature extraction and               │
│ dimensionality reduction techniques, for example with sparse autoencoders,   │
│ we create a representation space that encodes scientifically meaningful      │
│ information, such as the spectral and variability properties of the          │
│ astrophysical sources. Previously identified X-ray transients occupy         │
│ distinct, well-isolated clusters in the embedding space. Using clustering    │
│ techniques and nearest neighbor searches allows us to effectively explore    │
│ these transient-dominant clusters to discover new X-ray transients. We       │
│ collect the identified X-ray flare and dip candidates in a publicly          │
│ available catalog, serving as a fertile ground for new discoveries in        │
│ time-domain high-energy astrophysics.                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Among these candidates, we identify an intriguing extragalactic FXT,         │
│ XRT,200515, which exhibits unique temporal and spectral characteristics      │
│ distinct from any previously reported \emph{Chandra} FXTs. The transient's   │
│ initial hard $<$10,s burst shows a sharp rise exceeding 4 orders of          │
│ magnitude, followed by spectral softening in an $\sim$800,s oscillating      │
│ tail. This transient is likely related to either a giant magnetar flare      │
│ (GMF) from a distant soft gamma repeater (SGR) behind the Large Magellanic   │
│ Cloud (LMC) or an extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint LMXB in the  │
│ LMC. Each of these interpretations presents its own set of challenges.       │
│ Alternatively, XRT,200515 could be a new type of astronomical phenomenon     │
│ found by our anomaly detection method using machine learning.                │
│                                                                              │
│ Our method is the first unsupervised representation learning approach for    │
│ anomaly detection in high-energy astrophysics. It is applicable to datasets  │
│ from high-energy catalogs like \emph{Chandra}, \emph{XMM-Newton},            │
│ \emph{Swift-XRT}, \emph{eROSITA}, and \emph{Einstein Probe}. We created      │
│ semantically meaningful representations that were also used for regression   │
│ and classification \citep{sdthesis}. These can later be aligned with other   │
│ data modalities, such as optical images or infrared spectra to design        │
│ multi-modal models \citep{2024MNRAS.531.4990P, 2024arXiv240308851M,          │

│ using contrastive learning \citep{pmlr-v139-radford21a}, that can improve on │
│ current state-of-the-art methods used to characterize the associated         │
│ objects. Ultimately, this work and other representation and contrastive      │
│ learning approaches lay the groundwork for developing large-scale foundation │

│ learning. In \S~\ref{sec:results}, we present and discuss the results in     │
│ form of the semantically meaningful representation space of the event files, │
│ the catalog of X-ray transient candidates and the discovery of the new       │

│ We use data from the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) version 2.1                │
│ \citep{2024arXiv240710799E}, which includes all publicly available X-ray     │
│ sources detected by \emph{Chandra} as of December 2021. For this study, we   │
│ focus specifically on observations from the Advanced CCD Imaging             │
│ Spectrometer (ACIS). CSC 2.1 had not been fully released at the time our     │
│ analysis was performed, but catalog data was available for sources that had  │
│ completed processing in the \emph{Current Database View}}, a snapshot of     │
│ which we took on 11 April 2023. CSC 2.1 performs source detection on stacked │
│ observations, and catalog properties are provided both for these stack-level │
│ detections, and for each of observation-level detection that contribute to a │
│ stack detection. Because we are interested in short-time variability that    │
│ happens within a \emph{single} observation of a source, we use the catalog   │
│ products for the observation-level detections in our analysis. For a given   │
│ X-ray detection, two types of products are provided in the CSC: (i) database │
│ tables with source properties, such as fluxes in the different X-ray energy  │
│ bands, hardness ratios, variability indices, etc., and (ii) file-based data  │
│ products for each detection of a source, such as the detect regions, the     │
│ \emph{Chandra} PSF at that location, etc. The following observation-level    │
│ catalog properties are relevant for our analysis:                            │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{itemize} \item \verb+var_prob_b+: The probability that a source       │
│ detection is variable in time for the broad energy band (0.5--7,keV), as     │
│ estimated using the Gregory-Loredo algorithm \citep{1992ApJ...398..146G}. In │
│ this paper we call this quantity $p_{\rm{var}}^b$.                           │
│                                                                              │
│ \item \verb+var_index_b+: The variability index in the broad band, which     │
│ indicates the level of confidence for time variability. A variability index  │
│ of 6 or larger indicates variability at a confidence of at least 2$\sigma$.  │
│ In this paper we call this quantity $I_{\rm{var}}^b$.                        │
│                                                                              │
│ \item \verb+hard_<hs/ms/hm>+: The hardness ratios, which quantify the        │
│ relative fraction of photons detected in two given bands chosen between the  │
│ soft (0.5--1.2,keV), medium (1.2--2,keV), and hard (2--7,keV) bands for a    │
│ source detection. For example, a value of the hard-to-soft hardness ratio    │
│ close to 1 indicates that most of the photons detected are in the hard       │
│ energy band, whereas a value close to $-1$ indicates that most photons are   │
│ detected in the soft band. In this paper we call these quantities            │
│ $HR_{\rm{hs}}$, $HR_{\rm{ms}}$, and $HR_{\rm{hm}}$.                          │
│                                                                              │
│ \end{itemize}                                                                │
│                                                                              │
│ From the catalog data products available for observation-level X-ray         │
│ detections, we are interested in the region event file. This event file      │
│ consists of a list of all individual photon events detected in a small       │
│ bounding box around a source detection, listing their energies, arrival      │
│ times, and detector coordinates. These multivariate time series are the      │
│ basis for the characterization of an X-ray source: lightcurves, spectra,     │
│ images, coordinates, and other properties are derived from the distribution  │
│ of the listed quantities. In this analysis, we directly use these event      │
│ files as our primary data products. The values of the catalog properties     │
│ listed above serve as summary statistics for the detection associated with a │
│ given region event file. We only include event files with more than 5 events │
│ and a signal-to-noise ratio above 5 to minimize spurious signals from        │
│ low-number statistics in faint sources. We also exclude detections that are  │
│ flagged for pile-up. Pileup leads to a decrease in the observed count rate   │
│ and skews the spectrum towards higher energies \citep{davis2007pile}}, i.e., │
│ those with a pileup fraction larger than 5%, which corresponds to a maximum  │
│ pileup warning of 0.1 in CSC 2.1. For the resulting detections, we filter    │
│ the event files to include only events contained within the detection region │
│ for each source. These detection regions are also provided as data products  │
│ in CSC 2.1, and consist of the ellipse that includes the 90% encircled       │
│ counts fraction of the PSF at the source location. Due to the low background │
│ level in \emph{Chandra} observations, the majority of events selected after  │
│ this spatial filtering are expected to be events associated with the X-ray   │
│ source, not the background. In the selected event files, we only include     │
│ photon events within good time intervals (GTIs), which are time periods of   │
│ valid, high-quality data. No other pre-processing is required. The final     │
│ dataset consists of 95,473 filtered event files from 58,932 sources,         │
│ resulting in an average of $1.62$ observations per source. This includes     │
│ 9,003 new sources that have been added as part of the CSC 2.1 release, in    │
│ addition to the sources from the previous release.                           │
│                                                                              │

│ low-dimensional embedding space, which is clustered in the fourth step using │
│ density-based clustering. Previously identified transients occupy            │
│ well-isolated clusters on the edges of the embedding space, thus new         │
│ transients can be identified by exploring these transient-dominant edge      │
│ clusters and performing nearest-neighbor searches around known bona-fide     │
│ flares and dips. Finally, we compile these search results in a publicly      │
│ available catalog of transient candidates, serving as a fertile ground for   │
│ the discovery of new X-ray transients.} \label{fig:process} \end{figure*}    │

│ In this work, we introduce a novel representation learning based anomaly     │
│ detection method to systematically search for X-ray transients in            │
│ high-energy archives. We begin with an overview of the method here and       │
│ provide detailed explanations of each step in individual subsections. The    │
│ full pipeline is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:process}. Starting with the  │
│ event files described in \S~\ref{sec:data}, we (i) build two novel and       │
│ uniform event file representations by binning their arrival times and        │
│ energies into $E-t$~Maps (Event File Representation I) or $E-t-dt$~Cubes     │
│ (Event File Representation II); (ii) use principal component analysis        │
│ (Feature Extraction I) or sparse autoencoders (Feature Extraction II) to     │
│ extract informative features from the event file representations; (iii)      │
│ apply dimensionality reduction to the extracted features to create a         │
│ low-dimensional embedding space; (iv) use density-based clustering to create │
│ embedding clusters that group event files with similar characteristics, for  │
│ example transient behavior or certain spectral features. Previously          │
│ identified transients like the extragalactic magnetar-powered flare          │
│ candidate reported by \cite{2022ApJ...927..211L} and the extragalactic       │
│ planet candidate dip reported by \cite{2021NatAs...5.1297D}, shown in Figure │
│ \ref{linrosanne}, occupy well-isolated clusters in the embedding space.      │
│ Exploring these clusters and conducting nearest-neighbor searches enables us │
│ to effectively find analogs to bona-fide time-domain anomalies, while at the │
│ same time grouping them according to their spectral properties. We compile   │
│ the identified transient candidates in a catalog. While our approach is      │
│ designed and tested using \emph{Chandra} data, it is applicable to any       │
│ dataset consisting of event lists, like those from other high-energy         │
│ telescopes. The described transient detection approach is applied to both    │
│ types of event file representations with both feature extraction methods,    │
│ resulting in four different embeddings. We denote the different cases as     │

│ \subsection{Event File Representation} \label{sec:datarepp} The different    │
│ event files in the dataset are variable in length $N$ and duration $T$, as   │
│ shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:distributions}. The large variation in the   │
│ number of events and duration highlights the challenge in producing uniform  │
│ data representations that preserve relevant information on time variability  │
│ and spectral properties. While there exist machine learning architectures    │
│ that take variable length inputs, the significant differences in the number  │
│ of events from object to object make standardization of the inputs           │
│ challenging, even when these architectures are used                          │
│ \citep{2022SPIE12186E..0JM}. As a first step in our analysis, we introduce   │
│ 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional fixed-length representations based on an     │
│ informed binning strategy for the event files, similar to the DMDT maps for  │
│ optical lightcurves introduced by \citet{2017arXiv170906257M}.               │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsubsection{2D Histogram Representation ($E-t$~Maps)} Assume an event     │
│ file with $N$ photons and a photon arrival time column $\boldsymbol{t}$ with │
│ entries ${t_k}{k=1}^N$ and energy column $\boldsymbol{E}$ with entries       │
│ ${E_k}{k=1}^N$. The event file duration is given by $T = t_N - t_1$. The     │
│ energy column entries take values in the broad energy band of                │
│ \emph{Chandra}'s ACIS instrument, i.e. $E_k \in \left[E_{min},               │
│ E_{max}\right]$, where $E_{min}=0.5,\mathrm{keV}$ and                        │
│ $E_{max}=7,\mathrm{keV}$ comes from considering appropriate boundaries for   │
│ the energy response of \emph{Chandra}'s ACIS instrument. Beyond these        │
│ boundaries, the telescope's aperture effective area is low for the majority  │
│ of detected sources. First, we obtain the normalized time column, given by   │
│ $\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{\boldsymbol{t} - t_{1}}{T}$, and the logarithm of │
│ the energy column, given by $\boldsymbol{\epsilon} =                         │
│ \mathrm{log},\boldsymbol{E}$. The resulting boundaries for normalized time   │
│ column are $\boldsymbol{\tau} \in [\tau_{min}, \tau_{max}]$, where           │
│ $\tau_{min}=0$ and $\tau_{max}=1$. The range for the log-energy column is    │
│ $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\in [\epsilon_{min}, \epsilon_{max}]$, where           │
│ $\epsilon_{min}=\mathrm{log},0.5,\mathrm{keV}$ and                           │
│ $\epsilon_{max}=\mathrm{log},7,\mathrm{keV}$.                                │
│                                                                              │
│ Next, we determine the dimensionality of our representations. For a each     │
│ event file, we determine the optimal number of bins in the energy dimension, │
│ $n_{\epsilon}$, with the Freedman-Diaconis rule                              │
│ \citep{freedman1981histogram}, a widely used method that balances the        │
│ trade-off between too noisy histograms (too many bins) and not informative   │
│ enough histograms (too few bins). The optimal bin width $b_{\epsilon}$       │
│ according to this rule is calculated in the following way:                   │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} \quad b_{\epsilon} = 2                                      │
│ \frac{IQR(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})}{N^{~\frac{1}{3}}}, \label{freedman}        │
│ \end{equation} where $IQR(\epsilon)$ represents the interquartile range of   │
│ the $\epsilon$ values for a given event file of length $N$. Subsequently, we │
│ obtain the optimal number of energy bins $n_{\epsilon}$ with:                │
│ \begin{equation} n_{\epsilon} = \frac{\epsilon_{max} -                       │
│ \epsilon_{min}}{b_{\epsilon}}. \end{equation}                                │
│                                                                              │
│ For each event file, we determine the optimal number of bins in the time     │
│ dimension, $n_{\tau}$, with the help of the Bayesian Blocks algorithm, which │
│ was specifically developed for time series analysis in astronomy             │
│ \citep{bbscargle}. This algorithm partitions the time series into adaptive   │
│ width bins or blocks that are statistically distinct from neighboring        │
│ blocks; that is, within a given time-ordered Bayesian block, events grouped  │
│ in that block are consistent with having a similar event arrival rate. We    │
│ use the default \astropy implementation of Bayesian blocks, and set the      │
│ false alarm probability parameter to $p_0 = 0.01$ \citep{astropy}, which     │
│ implies a 1% probability of declaring a change of rate when there is none.   │
│ For each event file, we define the optimal uniform bin width $b_{\tau}$ as   │
│ the minimum bin width calculated by the Bayesian Blocks algorithm, and then  │
│ find the optimal number of time bins $n_{\tau}$ with:                        │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} n_{\tau} = \frac{\tau_{max} - \tau_{min}}{b_{\tau}}.        │
│ \label{bb} \end{equation}                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ The optimal number of bins is different for each event file, due to their    │
│ different lengths $N$ and durations $T$. To select a bin size that can be    │
│ applied to all event files, we consider the distributions of these optimal   │
│ bin sizes, which are shown in Figure \ref{Fig:ultiumatebinx}. For the        │
│ distribution of $n_{\tau}$ values we only use those event files for which    │
│ $p_{\rm{var}}^b > 0.9$. The intent of this is to effectively capture         │
│ variability timescales that are associated with short time-domain events,    │
│ such as flares and dips.                                                     │
│                                                                              │
│ We choose the $90$th percentile value of each distribution to set the final  │
│ number of bins in each dimension. That is, only 10% of the event files will  │
│ have an optimal number of bins that is larger than the chosen values         │
│ $n_{\epsilon}=16$ and $n_{\tau}=24$. The choice of the $90$th percentile,    │
│ rather than the mean or mode, is motivated by the need to capture sufficient │
│ statistical detail even for long event files, while keeping the size of the  │
│ resulting representations computationally tractable. Choosing a lower        │
│ resolution would risk losing significant details in the representation,      │
│ particularly short-duration events such as flares and dips within longer     │
│ event files. The $E-t$~Maps are the $2$D histogram representations with size │
│ $(n_{\tau},n_{\epsilon})=(24,16)$ that result from binning the events        │
│ according to the optimized number of bins.                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ Figure \ref{Fig:2drep} shows the $E-t$~Maps for the known extragalactic dip  │
│ reported by \cite{2021NatAs...5.1297D} and known extragalactic flare         │
│ reported by \cite{2022ApJ...927..211L}.                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsubsection{3D Histogram Representation ($E-t-dt$~Cubes)}                 │
│                                                                              │
│ We now introduce the $E-t-dt$~Cubes, which extend the $E-t$~Maps by a third  │
│ dimension that serves as a proxy for the photon arrival rate. For an event   │
│ file of length $N$, consider the array of time differences between           │
│ consecutive photon arrivals $\boldsymbol{\Delta t}$ with entries $\Delta t_k │
│ = t_{k+1} - t_k$ for $k=1,2,\ldots,N-1$. We again scale and normalize the    │
│ obtained values, so that they adopt values between $0$ and $1$, using in     │
│ each case the minimum value $\Delta t_{min}$ and maximum value $\Delta       │
│ t_{max}$. This provides the third dimension $\boldsymbol{\delta\tau}$:       │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} \boldsymbol{\delta\tau} = \frac{\boldsymbol{\Delta t} -     │
│ \Delta t_{min}}{\Delta t_{max} - \Delta t_{min}}. \end{equation}             │
│                                                                              │
│ The additional dimension is intended to better isolate short-duration        │
│ features in time variability by capturing high photon arrival rates, which   │
│ are typical of flares, as well as very low photon arrival rates, which are   │
│ typical of dips. The boundaries of our histogram representations in this     │
│ dimension are $\boldsymbol{\delta\tau} \in [\delta\tau_{min},                │
│ \delta\tau_{max}]$, where $\delta\tau_{min}=0$ and $\delta\tau_{max}=1$. We  │
│ determine the optimal number of bins in the $\boldsymbol{\delta\tau}$        │
│ dimension, $n_{\delta\tau}$, again by computing the optimal bin width        │
│ $b_{\delta\tau}$ with the Freedman-Diaconis rule and dividing the range for  │
│ $\boldsymbol{\delta\tau}$ by $b_{\delta\tau}$:                               │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} b_{\delta\tau} = 2                                          │
│ \frac{IQR(\boldsymbol{\delta\tau})}{N^{~\frac{1}{3}}}, \label{freedman2}     │
│ \end{equation}                                                               │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} n_{\delta\tau} = \frac{\delta\tau_{max} -                   │
│ \delta\tau_{min}}{b_{\delta\tau}}. \end{equation}                            │
│                                                                              │
│ The distribution of $n_{\delta\tau}$ across the event files is shown in      │
│ Figure \ref{Fig:ultiumatebinx}. Most of the relevant time-domain information │
│ is already captured by $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, but adding                       │
│ $\boldsymbol{\delta\tau}$ provides an additional marker for dips and flares  │
│ that can be shorter than the timescales probed by our chosen binning of      │
│ $\boldsymbol{\tau}$.                                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ Unlike in the other two dimensions, we choose the $75$th percentile value of │
│ the distribution as our final choice of common binning, which results in     │
│ $n_{\delta\tau}=16$. This is because in order to identify short transients,  │
│ we need to capture strong deviations in $\boldsymbol{\delta\tau}$ only.      │
│ Choosing a lower value for $n_{\delta\tau}$ reduces noise an improves        │
│ computational tractability. Having both $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ and              │
│ $\boldsymbol{\delta\tau}$ represented also breaks any assumption of          │
│ stationarity, in that we can be sensitive to transient events happening at   │
│ any time during the observation of the source, and break degeneracies        │
│ between periodic and non-periodic features in the representations presented  │
│ by \cite{2022SPIE12186E..0JM}. The $E-t-dt$~Cubes are the resulting $3$D     │
│ histogram event file representations with size                               │
│ $(n_{\tau},n_{\epsilon},n_{\delta\tau})=(24,16,16)$.                         │
│                                                                              │

│ We use \textit{Principal Component Analysis} (PCA) \citep{pearson1901liii}   │
│ provided by \texttt{scikit-learn} \citep{scikit-learn} as our first feature  │
│ extraction method. The extracted principal components should encode relevant │
│ time-domain and spectral information of the event file they represent. PCA   │
│ involves transforming a dataset into a new coordinate system by finding the  │
│ principal components of the data that capture most of the variance in the    │
│ data. By projecting the dataset onto principal components, PCA reduces the   │
│ dimensionality of the data while retaining the most important information,   │
│ which increases the interpretability of high-dimensional data.               │
│                                                                              │

│ We start with the feature vector set $\mathbf{X}$ of size $(m,n)$            │
│ representing our dataset with $m$ samples and $n$ dimensions. PCA aims to    │
│ find a new coordinate system defined by a set of orthogonal axes, i.e. the   │
│ principal components, that captures the maximum amount of variance in the    │
│ data. The PCA result is a transformed dataset $\mathbf{X_{pc}}$ obtained by  │
│ projecting $\mathbf{X}$ onto the principal components:                       │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} \mathbf{X_{pc}} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}, \end{equation}      │
│ where $\mathbf{W}$ is matrix of size $(n,n_{pc})$ containing the first       │
│ $n_{pc}$ principal components to be retained as its columns and              │
│ $\mathbf{X_{pc}}$ is of size ($m$, $n_{pc}$) with a reduced dimensionality   │
│ of $n_{pc}$. For a more detailed explanation of the algorithm, we refer the  │
│ reader to \cite{jolliffe2002principal}.                                      │
│                                                                              │

│ The main PCA hyperparameter is the number of principal components $n_{pc}$   │
│ to retain. Figure \ref{Fig:scree} shows two scree plots illustrating the     │
│ amount of variance explained by each principal component in descending order │
│ and the cumulative proportion of variance explained by the principal         │
│ components for both $E-t$~Maps and $E-t-dt$~Cubes. A common approach to      │
│ determine the optimal value of $n_{pc}$ is to find the knee point in the     │
│ cumulative scree plot of the principal components. This balances the         │
│ objective of minimizing the dimensionality while retaining as much           │
│ information as possible. Defining the knee point as the point beyond which   │
│ adding additional principal components increases the amount of variance by   │
│ less than $0.1$% gives $n_{pc}=15$ for $E-t$~Maps and $n_{pc}=22$ for        │
│ $E-t-dt$~Cubes as indicated in Figure \ref{Fig:scree}. These capture $94.1$% │
│ and $89.9$% of the variance respectively.                                    │

│                                                                              │
│ As an alternative to PCA, we now build \emph{Autoencoder}                    │
│ \citep{hinton2006reducing} models with \texttt{TensorFlow}                   │
│ \citep{tensorflow2015-whitepaper} to learn a set of latent features from the │
│ $E-t$~Maps and $E-t-dt$~Cubes that can be used to isolate transients and     │
│ encode specific spectral properties. An autoencoder is composed of two       │
│ neural networks, an encoder and a decoder, which work together to learn a    │
│ compressed representation of the input data. The encoder network takes the   │
│ input data and maps it to a lower-dimensional representation, often called   │
│ latent space' orbottleneck'. The number of neurons in the bottleneck         │
│ determines the dimensionality of the learned representation. The decoder     │
│ network then aims to reconstruct the original input from this compressed     │
│ representation. The decoder is typically a mirrored version of the encoder   │
│ gradually upsampling the latent space until the output matches the           │
│ dimensions of the original input. By minimizing the reconstruction error     │
│ between input and output during training, the model learns a low-dimensional │
│ representation of the input. The bottleneck forces the encoder to capture    │
│ the most important information necessary for accurate reconstruction,        │
│ effectively compressing the input and learning to extract informative        │
│ features in an unsupervised manner. Once the autoencoder is trained, the     │
│ encoder network can be used as a standalone feature extractor to obtain a    │
│ compressed representation of the input data, which can be used for           │
│ downstream tasks such as clustering or anomaly detection. As opposed to PCA, │
│ which is a linear technique that works well for linearly correlated data but │
│ fails to capture complex non-linear relationships, an autoencoder is able to │
│ learn complex non-linear relationships. We design two different autoencoders │
│ to process the $E-t$~Maps and $E-t-dt$~Cubes.                                │

│ In a convolutional autoencoder \citep{masci2011stacked}, both the encoder    │
│ and decoder network consist of convolutional layers                          │
│ \citep{lecun1998gradient}, which perform convolutions over the input using a │
│ filter. These filters are small matrix kernels with learnable weights that   │
│ slide across the input, allowing the network to capture high-level features  │
│ while preserving important spatial hierarchies and relationships, which is   │
│ why they are often used for image-like data. This makes this architecture    │
│ particularly well-suited to recognize spatial patterns such as dips or       │
│ flares in our $E-t$~Maps. To gradually reduce the dimension of the input     │
│ while it is being passed through the encoder network, we use stride          │
│ convolution layers \citep{simonyan2014very} with a stride value of 2 for     │
│ downsampling. This means that the learnable filter jumps two pixels at a     │
│ time as it slides over the input. The output of the convolutional layers is  │
│ a feature map, which is then flattened to a feature vector and passed        │
│ through a series of fully connected layers, where every neuron in the        │
│ previous layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. These fully   │
│ connected layers are responsible for mapping the learned features to a       │
│ lower-dimensional latent representation in the bottleneck and perform        │
│ non-linear transformations while downsampling through the use of non-linear  │
│ activation functions. The final latent space has $n_{ae}=12$ elements,       │
│ representing the most essential features of the input data, which can now be │
│ used for further downstream tasks. Figure \ref{xaecnn} shows a diagram of    │

│ Our $E-t-dt$~Cubes introduce an additional dimension resulting in sparse     │

│ them less effective for handling sparse data. Moreover, very expensive $3$D  │
│ convolutional operations would substantially increase complexity of the      │
│ model. Therefore, we use a simple fully connected autoencoder for the        │
│ $E-t-dt$~Cubes. Its encoder network consists of a series of fully connected  │
│ layers, which gradually map the original input data to a latent space with   │

│ Neural networks are able to learn and represent complex non-linear           │
│ relationships due to the introduction of non-linear activation functions     │
│ within their layers. An activation function is a mathematical function used  │
│ in a neural network to determine whether a neuron should be activated or     │
│ not, based on its input. It essentially decides how much of the input signal │
│ should pass through the neuron, producing an output that can either be       │
│ passed to the next layer or used to make predictions. The popular Rectified  │
│ Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function $ReLU(x) = \text{max}(0,x)$           │
│ \citep{nair2010rectified} is simple and computationally efficient. To        │
│ mitigate any potential encounters of the `dying the ReLU problem', where     │
│ neurons become non-responsive during training, we choose an extended version │
│ called Leaky ReLU \citep{maas2013rectifier}: \begin{equation} LeakyReLU(x) = │
│ \text{max}(\alpha x, x), \end{equation} where $\alpha=0.1$ is a              │
│ hyperparameter that defines the slope of the function for negative input     │
│ values. ReLU sets all negative values in the input to zero, while Leaky ReLU │
│ allows a small negative slope for negative inputs, which can help prevent    │
│ neurons from dying. As for the output layer, we want any values to be mapped │
│ to a range between $0$ and $1$, which is achieved by using the sigmoid       │
│ activation function: \begin{equation} sigmoid(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}.     │
│ \end{equation}                                                               │

│ In order to encourage the autoencoder to generate reconstructions close to   │
│ the original inputs, we use the mean squared error ($MSE$) as as a measure   │
│ of the reconstruction quality given by:                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ \begin{equation} MSE = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2,       │
│ \end{equation} where $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ element of the input vector and   │
│ $\hat{x}_i$ is the corresponding is reconstructed output. The $MSE$ is a     │
│ straightforward measure of reconstruction error, and its differentiability   │
│ allows efficient gradient computation for updating model weights via         │
│ gradient-based optimization.                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ Our neural networks are so called sparse autoencoders \citep{ng2011sparse},  │
│ which promote sparsity in the learned representation, meaning only a small   │
│ subset of the neurons in the network are active at any given time. Sparse    │
│ representations are valuable for our work because they help extract highly   │
│ informative features from the input, while disregarding irrelevant or noisy  │
│ information. To encourage sparsity in the latent space, we introduce a L1    │
│ regularization term in the objective, resulting in the following loss        │
│ function: \begin{equation} L = MSE + \lambda \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{n_w} \lvert   │
│ w_j \rvert = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \hat{x}i)^2 + \lambda \cdot   │
│ \sum{j=1}^{n_w} \lvert w_j \rvert, \end{equation} where $\lambda=0.1$ is the │
│ regularization strength and $w_j$ are the individual bottleneck weight       │
│ values of which there are $n_w$ in total. L1 regularization pushes small     │
│ weights to zero and thus helps the model prioritize the most significant     │
│ features of the input data, leading to a semantically meaningful latent      │
│ space.                                                                       │

│ Starting with the original dataset with a $m =$ 95,473 samples and using a   │
│ test split of $0.1$ gives us a training and validation set of length 85,925  │
│ and a test set of length 9,548. Further using a validation split of $0.2$,   │
│ gives 68,740 samples for training and 17,185 for validation. We run the      │
│ training process for a maximum of 200 epochs with a batch size of 1,024      │
│ samples. The initial learning rate was set to $0.01$ along with an on        │
│ plateau learning rate scheduler, which dynamically reduces the learning rate │
│ by a factor of $0.1$ if the validation loss plateaus for longer than $10$    │
│ epochs. Reducing the learning rate when a plateau is detected can help       │
│ escape local minima in the loss surface and converge to a more optimal       │
│ solution in the parameter space. This scheduler is used in combination with  │
│ the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) optimizer \citep{kingma2014adam},      │
│ which is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm combining the benefits of   │
│ both adaptive learning rates \citep{duchi2011adaptive} and momentum-based    │
│ optimization techniques \citep{sutskever2013importance}. Finally, we use an  │
│ early stopping callback to monitor the validation loss. It automatically     │
│ interrupts the training process if the validation loss does not improve for  │
│ $25$ epochs and restores the weights of the model to the best observed       │
│ weights during training. The training process for both autoencoder models is │
│ shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:training}. Once the autoencoder is trained,  │
│ we can use the encoder to transform the original dataset $\mathbf{X}$ to the │
│ feature vector space $\mathbf{X_{ae}}$ of size ($m$, $n_{ae}$) with a        │

│ representations using PCA or sparse autoencoders. The t-SNE algorithm is a   │
│ method used to map the input data onto a low-dimensional embedding space,    │
│ and is particularly useful for the visualization of clusters and patterns in │
│ high-dimensional datasets. Each high-dimensional sample is transformed into  │
│ a low-dimensional embedding in such a way that similar object are nearby     │
│ points, while dissimilar objects are distant points in the embedding space.  │
│ Essentially, it aims to capture the local structure of the data by           │
│ preserving the pairwise similarities between objects while mapping them to a │
│ lower-dimensional embedding space.                                           │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsubsection{Algorithm}                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ We use our informative features, $\mathbf{X_{if}}=\mathbf{X_{pc}}$ or        │
│ $\mathbf{X_{if}}=\mathbf{X_{ae}}$, as input to the t-SNE algorithm to reduce │
│ the data to a two-dimensional embedding, denoted as $\mathbf{Z}$. First,     │
│ t-SNE creates a probability distribution $P$ for pairs of high-dimensional   │
│ data points in $\mathbf{X_{if}}$, assigning higher probabilities to similar  │
│ pairs and lower probabilities to dissimilar ones. This is done by modeling   │
│ pairwise similarities using a Gaussian kernel with a specific perplexity     │
│ parameter, which controls the effective number of neighbors considered for   │
│ each point. Next, t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution $Q$ for   │
│ the pairwise similarities in the low-dimensional space $\mathbf{Z}$, modeled │
│ using a Student's t-distribution. The goal of t-SNE is to minimize the       │
│ difference between $P$ and $Q$ using gradient descent, with the              │
│ Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence \citep{kullback1951information} as the cost │
│ function: \begin{equation} D_{KL}(P,|,Q) = \sum_{i \neq j} P_{ij}            │
│ \log\frac{P_{ij}}{Q_{ij}}, \end{equation} where $P_{ij}$ and $Q_{ij}$        │
│ represent pairwise similarities in the high- and low-dimensional spaces,     │
│ respectively. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the low-dimensional          │
│ embedding $\mathbf{Z}$ to minimize the KL divergence, often requiring        │
│ hundreds to thousands of iterations for convergence. The result of this      │
│ optimization is a two-dimensional representation $\mathbf{Z}$ of size $(m,   │
│ 2)$, where similar points in the high-dimensional space are clustered        │
│ closely together. \subsubsection{Hyperparameter Optimization}                │
│                                                                              │
│ The t-SNE algorithm has a number of important hyperparameters to be tuned.   │
│ The two most important parameters are the \texttt{perplexity} and the        │
│ \texttt{learning_rate}. The \texttt{perplexity} parameter controls the       │
│ balance between capturing the local versus global structure in the data,     │
│ while the \texttt{learning_rate} controls the step size at each iteration of │
│ the optimization process. The \texttt{n_iter} parameter is the number of     │
│ iterations. To ensure reproducibility, we set a fixed \texttt{random_state}. │
│ Our t-SNE hyperparameter optimization approach is detailed in Appendix       │
│ \ref{appendix:hyperparameters}. A summary of the final t-SNE hyperparameters │

│ The next step is the identification of individual clusters in the embedding  │
│ space using \dbscan \citep{hartigan1979algorithm}, short for Density-Based   │
│ Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. Unlike traditional clustering │

│ to be specified, as it identifies dense regions in the data space based on a │
│ density criterion.                                                           │

│ We use our t-SNE embedding space $\mathbf{Z}$ as input to the DBSCAN         │
│ algorithm, which segments the embedding space into multiple clusters. The    │
│ DBSCAN algorithm has two main hyperparameters. The \texttt{eps} parameter    │
│ defines the radius of the neighborhood surrounding each point in the         │
│ dataset, while the \texttt{minPts} parameter specifies the minimum number of │
│ points required within this neighborhood for a data point to be classified   │
│ as a core point. A border point is defined as a point that is in the         │
│ vicinity of at least one core point but has fewer than \texttt{minPts}       │
│ within its neighborhood. All other points are considered to be noise points. │
│ Clusters are then created from the aggregation of core points and their      │
│ associated border points, with noise points being categorized as outliers.   │
│ Figure \ref{dbscan} visualizes the clustering method.                        │

│ New transients are identified in embedding clusters containing previously    │
│ reported transients. For well-isolated clusters containing known discovered  │
│ transients, we use the entire cluster to define new transient candidates.    │
│ The well-isolated transient-dominant clusters used for candidate selection   │

│ \section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results} We now present the      │
│ results of applying the methods in \S~\ref{sec:methods} to the set of        │
│ representations of X-ray event files in the dataset from \S~\ref{sec:data}.  │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsection{Representation Embedding Space and Clusters}                     │
│                                                                              │
│ Figure \ref{Fig:tsneHAR} shows the t-SNE embedding space for the             │
│ \textit{3D-PCA} and \textit{3D-AE} cases color-coded by the hardness ratio   │
│ $HR_{\rm{hs}}$. The embedding space for the other two cases, \textit{2D-PCA} │
│ and \textit{2D-AE}, are shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:embeddings}. The     │
│ observed hardness ratio gradients in all embedding spaces indicate that the  │
│ learned representations effectively encode spectral information, in          │
│ particular at the level of individual clusters, allowing for the             │
│ identification of X-ray sources with specific spectral signatures. For the   │
│ \textit{2D-PCA} and \textit{2D-AE} cases, these gradients are more uniform   │
│ across the embedding space, because the temporal and spectral information of │
│ event files are captured by one axis each in the $E-t$,Maps. Moreover, some  │
│ clusters consist exclusively of soft or hard sources, demonstrating that our │
│ representations can be leveraged not only to identify transients but also to │
│ find analogs to sources with specific spectral characteristics.              │
│                                                                              │
│ Figure \ref{Fig:tsneVAR} shows the \textit{3D-PCA} and \textit{3D-AE}        │
│ embedding spaces, now color-coded by the variability index                   │
│ $I_{\rm{index}}^b$ with the other two cases shown in Appendix                │
│ \ref{appendix:embeddings}. The learned embeddings also encode the temporal   │
│ behavior of the sources, with some clusters being dominated by X-ray         │
│ detections with significant variability, including transient behavior. To    │
│ demonstrate this, we also highlight the embeddings of the bona-fide flares   │
│ and dips listed in Table \ref{tab:bonafide_flares}. Note that these occupy   │
│ very well-defined clusters on the edges of the representation space,         │
│ allowing for queries of analog transient behavior. In the \textit{2D-PCA}    │
│ and \textit{2D-AE} cases, transient sources are distributed across multiple  │
│ small clusters on the edges of the embedding spaces. In contrast, the        │
│ \textit{3D-PCA} and \textit{3D-AE} embedding spaces achieve a significantly  │
│ more compact clustering of bona-fide transients because temporal features in │
│ the event files are given a higher importance by the introduction of an      │
│ additional time-related axis in the $E-t-dt$,Cubes.                          │
│                                                                              │
│ Figure \ref{fig:dbscanClusters} shows the clusters identified by the DBSCAN  │
│ algorithm in the \textit{3D-PCA} and \textit{3D-AE} cases. The clusters for  │
│ the other two cases, \textit{2D-PCA} and \textit{2D-AE}, are shown in        │
│ Appendix \ref{appendix:embeddings}. The largest cluster in all cases         │
│ (Cluster 1) corresponds to observations that are not 'anomalous', for        │
│ example non-variable sources or noisy detections in the low-count regime. We │
│ also see multiple smaller clusters on the edges of the embedding space       │
│ clearly separated from this main cluster. Of special interest are clusters   │
│ that contain known discovered transients, as these likely host other         │
│ interesting transients that have not yet been discovered. Some of the edge   │
│ clusters group observations with similar temporal and spectral behavior. For │
│ example, Cluster 4 in the \textit{3D-PCA} case only contains flares with     │
│ high hardness ratios. Other clusters instead group observations primarily by │
│ similar temporal behavior, but then show a within-cluster grouping of        │
│ similar spectral behaviors. For example, Cluster 4 in the \textit{3D-AE}     │
│ case contains many dipping sources, but show a hardness ratio gradient       │
│ within the cluster. When comparing the results of different feature          │
│ extraction methods, we observe that in the \textit{3D-AE} embedding space,   │
│ nearly all previously identified extragalactic FXTs live within a single,    │
│ well-isolated cluster (Cluster 8). In contrast, the \textit{3D-PCA}          │
│ embedding space distributes these extragalactic FXTs across multiple         │
│ clusters. All of these points underline the effectiveness of our method and  │
│ that the created representation space is highly informative.                 │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsection{Catalog of X-ray Flare and Dip Candidates}                       │
│                                                                              │
│ We identify new transient candidates within clusters that are occupied by    │
│ previously reported transients and by conducting nearest-neighbor searches   │
│ around these known transients. We compile these in a catalog of X-ray        │
│ transient candidates, which includes both flares and dips. The selected      │
│ clusters used to define the new flare and dip candidates in addition to the  │
│ 50 nearest neighbors of each bona-fide transient are given in Appendix       │
│ \ref{appendix:transdomclus}. Note that from each selected flare cluster, we  │
│ include only X-ray detections with a variability index                       │
│ $I_{\rm{var}}^b\geq5$, corresponding to at least 90% confidence in           │
│ variability per the Gregory-Loredo algorithm, ensuring statistical           │
│ significance. We also include a select group of interesting sources          │
│ identified as non-clustered points within the embeddings, particularly       │
│ pulsating or quasi-periodic sources, to the flare candidates. Lastly, we     │
│ manually exclude a fraction of false positives identified by visual          │
│ inspection of the lightcurves. The resulting catalog contains a total of     │
│ 3,559 detections (3,447 flares and 112 dips), with the catalog columns       │
│ described in Appendix \ref{appendix:columns}. Table \ref{tab:cata10} shows   │
│ the first 5 samples in our catalog for a subset of columns. Figure           │
│ \ref{Fig:dip_ex} shows a number of example lightcurves of the dips and       │
│ flares in our catalog. The dip selection shows dips from LMXBs, a high-mass  │
│ X-ray binary (HMXB), the glitching pulsar PSR,J0537$-$6910                   │
│ \citep{2004ApJ...603..682M}, a cataclysmic binary, and the lensed quasar     │
│ HE,0230$-$2130 \citep{1999A&A...348L..41W}. The flare selection shows flares │
│ from an eruptive variable, a RS CVn variable, a brown dwarf candidate, a     │
│ HMXB, the redback pulsar PSR,J1048+2339 \citep{2016ApJ...823..105D} and an   │
│ active galacti nucleus (AGN). We also show pulsating or quasi-periodic       │
│ lightcurves from a magnetic cataclysmic variable, the peculiar LMXB          │
│ IGR,J16358$-$4726 \citep{2003IAUC.8109....2K, 2004ApJ...602L..45P,           │
│ 2007ApJ...657..994P} and a pulsar. Figure \ref{Fig:dip_distirbutions} shows  │
│ the distribution of SIMBAD object types in our transient catalog. About 25%  │
│ of the transient candidates do not have a SIMBAD match, making them          │
│ particularly interesting sources for new transient discoveries. Our dip      │
│ candidates include 6 \emph{Chandra} observations with prominent dips from    │
│ the known source CXOGlb J002400.9$-$720453 in the globular cluster NGC,104   │
│ (47,Tuc). The catalog identifiers for these are \texttt{CATALOG_ID:          │
│ 2737_139, 16527_79, 15747_79, 16529_79, 15748_79, 16528_14}. Our flare       │
│ candidates include a newly discovered extragalactic FXT, which is            │
│ characterized and discussed in detail in \S~\ref{sec:xrt200515}. Its catalog │
│ identifier is \texttt{CATALOG_ID: 23022_122}. We recommend using our catalog │
│ to identify a diverse range of flares and dips. While this work is primarily │
│ motivated by the discovery of new extragalactic transients, we intentionally │
│ did not exclude galactic stellar flares to enable systematic follow-up       │
│ studies to study flare incidence rates, the rotational evolution of stars    │
│ and more. Users interested exclusively in extragalactic transients can       │
│ filter out galactic sources using metadata from the CSC and the cross-match  │
│ columns in the catalog.                                                      │

│ \label{sec:xrt200515}                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Among the flare candidates in our catalog, we discovered an intriguing new   │
│ extragalactic \emph{Chandra} FXT in an observation of the supernova remnant  │
│ SNR 0509$-$67.5 in the LMC on May 15, 2020 \citep{2022AJ....164..231G}. What │
│ made this transient stand out from thousands of other flares discovered in   │
│ this work is the unique temporal variability in its lightcurve, which        │
│ exhibits no detectable pre-flare X-ray emission, a sharp rise of at least 4  │
│ orders of magnitude in the count rate to peak intensity followed by a sharp  │
│ fall, all in a matter of a $<$10,s, down to $\sim$800,s long oscillating     │
│ tail. There is also notable spectral variability during the flare,           │
│ characterized by an initially hard spectrum at the peak, followed by         │
│ spectral softening in the tail. The combination of these temporal and        │
│ spectral properties establishes this transient as the first of its kind      │
│ within the sample of discovered \emph{Chandra} FXTs. We designate this newly │
│ discovered FXT as XRT,200515 and present a detailed study and discussion of  │
│ its potential origins.                                                       │
│                                                                              │

│                                                                              │
│ The transient XRT,200515 was detected in \emph{Chandra} ObsID 23022. The     │
│ target of the observation was the supernova remnant SNR 0509$-$67.5 in the   │
│ LMC, which is shown in Figure \ref{Fig:xrt_in_sky} alongside the newly       │
│ discovered FXT event. Table \ref{tab:nstable} summarizes the properties of   │
│ XRT,200515 and its associated \emph{Chandra} source 2CXO J051117.2$-$672556  │
│ in ObsID 23022. The transient was captured by the ACIS camera in the S4      │
│ chip, and is located significantly off-axis in this observation, at an       │
│ angular distance of 11.75,arcmin from the aimpoint in the S3 chip. This      │
│ leads to an elongated and relatively large PSF, which, in this case, is      │
│ advantageous as it substantially reduces photon pile-up in the initial       │
│ spike, by spreading the counts over many pixels. We processed the data of    │
│ \emph{Chandra} observation ObsID 23022 with the Chandra Interactive Analysis │
│ of Observations ({\sc{ciao}}) version 4.15 \citep{2006SPIE.6270E..1VF}, with │
│ calibration data base version 4.9.8. In particular, we created a new level-2 │
│ event file with the {\sc{ciao}} task {\texttt{chandra_repro}} and filter it  │
│ in energy and time with {\texttt{dmcopy}}. We obtained the sky position in   │
│ Table \ref{tab:nstable} using the {\sc{ciao}} tool \texttt{wavdetect}. To    │
│ reduce background noise and improve the determination of the source          │
│ centroid, we applied \texttt{wavdetect} on an image filtered to include only │

│ and decaying tail. We estimate a $T_{90} \sim $ 580--740,s for the photons   │
│ observed in the 0.3--7,keV band$ is the time interval during which the       │

│ counts, respectively), hence the burst duration of $<$10,s. The rise and     │
│ fall times of the burst are both between 3.2,s and 6.4,s. The maximum count  │
│ rate at the \emph{Chandra} frame time resolution is $\sim$9.7,counts/s,      │
│ acting as the lower bound for the peak count rate of the burst. Those counts │
│ are spatially spread over a PSF area of $\sim$3000 pixels; therefore,        │
│ pile-up is not an issue. We evaluated the hardness ratio evolution during    │
│ the flare with the Bayesian estimation method \texttt{BEHR}                  │
│ \citep{2006ApJ...652..610P}. Here, the hardness ratio is defined as:         │

│ is the number of soft photons (0.3--1.2,keV), $m$ is the number of medium    │
│ photons (1.2--2,keV), and $h$ is the number of hard photons (2--7,keV) in    │
│ each bin. We also track the running average of the photon energies during    │
│ the flare with a moving window of $\pm10$,counts. The hardness ratio and     │
│ energy evolution indicate spectral softening during the flare, with the      │
│ hardness ratio starting at 1 during the hard burst peak and decreasing to a  │

│ reprocessed event file of {\it{Chandra}} ObsID 23022. We used the same       │
│ source and background extraction regions defined for the lightcurve          │
│ extraction. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the source, we extracted │
│ the spectrum only from the time interval $t_0 + 920$,s. We binned the        │
│ spectrum to a minimum of 1 count per bin with the {\texttt{grppha}} task     │
│ within the {\sc{ftools}} package suite \citep{blackburn95} from NASA's High  │
│ Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC)}. For all      │
│ spectral modelling and flux estimates, we used the {\sc{xspec}} software     │
│ version 12.13.0 \citep{arnaud1996astronomical}. With only 179 net counts, we │
│ are unable to fit complex spectral models; thus, we limit our analysis to    │
│ the simplest one-component models representative of opposite scenarios: a    │
│ power law (\texttt{powerlaw}) and a blackbody model (\texttt{bbody}), both   │
│ modified by photo-electric absorption (\texttt{tbabs}). In both cases, we    │
│ adopted the Tuebingen-Boulder absorption model with Wilms abundances         │
│ \citep{wilms00}. We minimized the Cash statistic                             │
│ \citep{1979ApJ...228..939C}, as we do not have enough counts for $\chi^2$    │
│ fitting.                                                                     │

│ The best-fitting power-law model (Table \ref{table:specfit} and Figure       │
│ \ref{Fig:spectralfit10}) has a photon index of                               │
│ $\Gamma=[NUMERICAL_RESULT]\pm0.3$. The fit statistics yield a null           │
│ hypothesis probability of $3.5 \times 10^{-3}$, with a Cstat value of 132.7  │
│ for 137 degrees of freedom. For the blackbody model, the best-fitting        │
│ temperature is $kT_{\rm{bb}} = [NUMERICAL_RESULT]\pm0.3$,keV (Table          │
│ \ref{table:specfit}). The fit statistics yield a null hypothesis probability │
│ of $1.2 \times 10^{-2}$, with a Cstat value of 129.6 for 137 degrees of      │
│ freedom. The reason this blackbody spectrum may appear hard in the           │
│ {\it{Chandra}} band, resembling a $\Gamma\sim0.5$ power law, is that at a    │
│ temperature of $kT_{\rm{bb}}\sim[NUMERICAL_RESULT]$,keV, the ACIS detector   │
│ samples only the peak and the Rayleigh-Jeans (rising) portion of the         │
│ blackbody emission. We can use either model to determine an average          │
│ conversion between the count rate and luminosity. This will then enable us   │
│ to estimate the peak luminosity in the initial spike, for which we have      │
│ previously estimated a peak count rate of $\gtrsim$10,counts/s. The          │
│ best-fitting power law model implies a peak flux of $F_{\rm{p}} \gtrsim 5.6  │
│ \times 10^{-10}$,erg/s/cm$^2$, a total flare fluence of $E_{\rm{f}} \gtrsim  │
│ 1.1 \times 10^{-8}$,erg/cm$^2$, and a peak unabsorbed 0.3--10,keV luminosity │
│ of $L_{\rm X}\gtrsim1.7$ $\times$ $10^{38}$,erg/s at the LMC distance of     │
│ 50,kpc. For the best-fitting blackbody model, the peak flux and flare        │
│ fluence would be $F_{\rm{p}} \gtrsim 4.0 \times 10^{-10}$,erg/s/cm$^2$ and   │
│ $E_{\rm{f}} \gtrsim 0.8 \times 10^{-8}$,erg/cm$^2$ respectively. The peak    │
│ unabsorbed 0.3--10,keV luminosity would be $L_{\rm X}\gtrsim1.2$ $\times$    │
│ $10^{38}$,erg/s and the peak bolometric luminosity would be $L_{\rm          │
│ bol}\gtrsim1.5 \times 10^{38}$,erg/s. These values should be considered      │
│ conservative lower limits for two reasons: (i) the peak count rate provides  │
│ only a lower bound estimate, as it is constrained by the \emph{Chandra}      │
│ frame time resolution of the observations, potentially underestimating the   │
│ true peak count rate; and (ii) the conversion factor applied is derived from │
│ the average spectrum over the entire flare, even though the spectrum of the  │
│ initial spike is significantly harder compared to the tail, as shown in      │
│ Figure \ref{Fig:tempfit}.                                                    │

│ We used the X-ray source coordinates reported in Table \ref{tab:nstable} to  │
│ search for optical counterparts to XRT,200515. The field of XRT,200515 was   │
│ covered by the Survey of Magellanic Stellar History (\emph{SMASH})           │
│ \citep{2017AJ....154..199N}, a deep optical survey in the \emph{ugriz} bands │
│ with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) mounted on the Víctor M. Blanco          │
│ Telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. We │
│ used the Astro Data Lab Jupyter Notebook server \citep{2020A&C....3300411N,  │
│ 2021CSE....23b..15J} to access and visualize the \emph{SMASH} catalog}.      │
│ Figure \ref{Fig:smash} shows a color image of the field created from the     │
│ deepest available stacked images in the \emph{u}, \emph{g} and \emph{i}      │
│ bands; the 5$\sigma$ detection limits in these bands are 23.9,mag, 24.8,mag  │
│ and 24.2,mag, respectively. The images were taken on December 7, 2015 with   │
│ exposure times of 1,179,s, 981,s and 1,179,s respectively. The astrometry of │
│ the \emph{SMASH} images is calibrated on the Gaia DR3 reference frame, thus  │
│ their positional uncertainty is negligible compared to the X-ray source      │
│ position uncertainty. Within the \emph{Chandra} position error circle in     │
│ Figure \ref{Fig:smash}, there is no obvious optical counterpart that stands  │
│ out in brightness or color from the surrounding stellar population. We       │
│ performed relative photometry on the sources inside the error circle,        │
│ comparing them to several nearby sources with known positions and            │
│ brightnesses listed in the Gaia DR3 catalog. We used the \emph{SMASH}        │
│ \emph{g} band as the closest approximation to Gaia's \emph{G} band. We       │
│ estimate the brightest optical source within the error circle to have a Vega │
│ magnitude of $g=22.7\pm0.1,\mathrm{mag}$, corresponding to an absolute       │
│ magnitude of $M_{g}\approx4.2$, assuming it is in the LMC. Additionally,     │
│ three other point-like sources are detected with $g$ band magnitudes in the  │
│ range of 23--24,mag. All four sources appear point-like, consistent with the │
│ seeing conditions of the \emph{SMASH} survey, with no evidence of any        │
│ spatially extended background galaxies. The three brightest stars visible in │
│ Figure \ref{Fig:smash} within $\sim$12,arcsec of the \emph{Chandra} source   │
│ are solar-mass stars on the red giant branch, indicative of an old stellar   │
│ population. The lack of bright optical counterparts and the short burst      │
│ duration of $<$10,s rules out a stellar flare from a foreground Galactic     │
│ low-mass star \citep{2004A&ARv..12...71G,                                    │

│ 81K}. A flare from a Be/X-ray binary or any other HMXB in the LMC is also    │
│ excluded by the lack of a bright optical counterpart                         │
│ \citep{2019ApJ...881L..17D,2022A&A...661A..22D}. The temporal and spectral   │
│ properties of XRT,200515, combined with the absence of an optical            │
│ counterpart, suggest three possibilities: (i) a relativistic jet phenomenon, │
│ such as a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB); (ii) a rapid, high-energy process linked │
│ to extreme magnetic fields, such as a giant magnetar flare (GMF); or (iii) a │

│ re-investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of this work. Here, we    │
│ simply point out that XRT,200515, like the other \emph{Chandra} FXTs in the  │

│ XRT,200515 has a significantly harder spectrum ([NUMERICAL_RESULT]) in the   │
│ \emph{Chandra} band than the rest of the FXT sample, all of which have       │

│ 0413795Q,2023ApJ...948...91E}. A photon index of [NUMERICAL_RESULT] below    │
│ 10,keV is indeed expected and observed from both core-collapse GRBs and      │
│ compact-merger GRBs \citep{ghirlanda09,bromberg13,2018A&A...616A.138O,       │
│ 2019A&A...625A..60R,2021A&A...652A.123T}. This might support the association │
│ of the initial spike of XRT,200515 with a GRB. However, the presence and     │
│ properties of the $\sim$800,s tail (candidate GRB afterglow) is puzzling.    │
│ The $T_{90} \sim $ 580--740,s value for XRT,200515 is significantly shorter  │

│ pushing the limit for a GRB afterglow detection \citep{wichern24}. Moreover, │
│ XRT,200515's initial burst duration ($<$10,s), its short rise and fall times │
│ (3.2-6.4,s), and the lack of a peak plateau are inconsistent with the        │

│ Based on its temporal and spectral variability, it is tempting to interpret  │
│ XRT,200515 as a rare GMF from a SGR \citep{2008A&ARv..15..225M,              │
│ 2015RPPh...78k6901T} in the LMC or behind it, which can easily explain the   │
│ burst's strong increase of at least 4 orders of magnitude in $<$10,s         │
│ \citep{2018MNRAS.474..961C}. Similar to XRT,200515, GMFs are characterized   │
│ by a short and hard initial spike and a longer and softer, pulsating tail.   │
│ GMFs are extremely rare, with only a select few ever discovered.             │
│ Well-studied examples are SGR 0526$-$66 in the LMC                           │
│ \citep{1979Natur.282..587M}, and the Galactic sources SGR 1900$+$14          │
│ \citep{1999Natur.397...41H} and SGR 1806$+$20 \citep{2005Natur.434.1098H,    │
│ 2005Natur.434.1107P, 2005ApJ...628L..53I}. More recently, GMFs have been     │
│ identified in M,31 \citep{mazets08}, NGC,253 \citep{2021NatAs...5..385F,     │
│ 2021Natur.589..211S,2021Natur.589..207R,trigg24} and M,82                    │
│ \citep{2024Natur.629...58M}. All of these have been observed by high time    │
│ resolution instruments in the hard X-rays and soft $\gamma$-rays with        │
│ luminosities above $10^{46}$,erg/s for a fraction of a second in the initial │
│ spike. The tails of GMFs are often modulated by magnetar spin periods of     │
│ 2--12,s, leading to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). For XRT,200515,      │
│ there is no hard X-ray or $\gamma$-ray detection, despite the LMC direction  │
│ being in good visibility for most of the previously mentioned high-energy    │
│ facilities. We were unable to identify any significant periodicities in the  │
│ tail of XRT,200515 through periodogram analysis, which is unsurprising given │
│ the low time resolution of \emph{Chandra} observations. No X-ray activity    │
│ has been observed by \emph{Chandra} or other X-ray telescopes in the years   │
│ before or after XRT,200515, which may be because SGRs are very faint when    │
│ they are not bursting. The strongest argument against a magnetar in the LMC  │
│ as the origin of XRT,200515 is that magnetars are short-lived objects        │
│ ($\lesssim$10$^5$,yr) associated to young stellar populations                │
│ \citep{olausen14,nakano15,mondal21}. Even allowing for the persistence of    │
│ magnetar-like activity in ordinary radio pulsars as old as $\sim$10$^7$,yr   │
│ \citep{rea10}, this scenario is still inconsistent with the old stellar      │
│ population (several Gyr) in the LMC field shown in Figure \ref{Fig:smash}.   │
│ The nearest star-forming regions in the LMC are $\sim$10,arcmin              │
│ ($\sim$150,pc) away. If (in a very contrived scenario), we assume that       │
│ XRT,200515 is powered by a young neutron star ejected from one of those      │
│ regions, we estimate a characteristic time of 1,Myr to travel that distance  │
│ at a speed of 150,km/s. Therefore, if XRT,200515 is a GMF, it must be        │
│ located behind the LMC, in a low-redshift galaxy                             │
│ \citep{2005Natur.434.1098H,2005Natur.438..991T}. Since GMFs have been        │
│ observed only a few times and never at soft X-ray energies, their properties │
│ in the soft X-ray band detectable by \emph{Chandra} remain largely           │
│ unexplored. XRT,200515 could indeed be the first GMF detected at soft X-ray  │
│ energies. Distinguishing distant short GRBs from GMFs has historically been  │
│ difficult and there are multiple studies suggesting that a subset of short   │
│ GRBs are actually extragalactic GMFs \citep{2005Natur.434.1098H,             │
│ 2005Natur.434.1107P, 2005Natur.438..991T, 2006ApJ...652..507O,               │
│ 2008ApJ...680..545M, 2011AdSpR..47.1337H, 2020ApJ...899..106Y,               │
│ 2021Natur.589..211S, 2023IAUS..363..284N}. Just as for the distant GRB       │
│ interpretation, the non-detection of any optical counterpart remains         │
│ puzzling for a distant GMF scenario, unless we are dealing with a very       │
│ distant and exceptionally luminous GMF.                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsubsection{Thermonuclear X-ray Burst from a quiet LMXB in the LMC?}      │
│                                                                              │
│ If XRT,200515 is in the LMC, a peak luminosity near the Eddington luminosity │
│ $L_{\rm{Edd}}\sim10^{38}$,erg/s and sharp rise time of the flare suggests a  │
│ Type I X-ray burst interpretation, which is a thermonuclear explosion on the │
│ surface of a weakly magnetized, accreting neutron star                       │
│ \citep{lewin93,strohmayer06,galloway08,galloway20,galloway21,alizai23}. The  │
│ old stellar population in the field of XRT,200515 is consistent with the     │
│ presence of neutron star LMXBs. Following the definition of burst timescale  │
│ $\tau = E_{\rm f}/F_ {\rm p}$ in \cite{galloway08}, we estimate $\tau \sim   │
│ 20$,s for XRT,200515, which is consistent with Type I X-ray bursts           │
│ \citep{galloway21,alizai23}. The fitted temperature $kT_{\rm{bb}} \sim       │
│ [NUMERICAL_RESULT]$,keV when the average spectrum is fitted with a simple    │
│ blackbody, and the softening of the spectrum (temperature decrease) in the   │
│ tail is also typical of Type I X-ray bursts \citep{galloway08,galloway20,    │
│ guver12}. On the other hand, several observed properties of XRT,200515 are   │
│ unusual for Type I X-ray bursts. In particular, most Type I X-ray bursts     │
│ occur when the persistent luminosity (proportional to the accretion rate) of │
│ a LMXB is $L_{\rm{X}} >10^{-4} L_{\rm{Edd}}$ (and, in most cases,            │
│ $L_{\rm{X}}>10^{-3} L_{\rm{Edd}}$) \citep{galloway08}. Instead, in the       │
│ initial part of ObsID 23022, the upper limit on the X-ray luminosity at the  │
│ position of XRT,200515 is $L_{\rm{X}}<10^{-4} L_{\rm{Edd}}$, so that the     │
│ X-ray flux increased by at least 4 orders of magnitudes. On another note,    │
│ the sharp decline after the initial burst of XRT,200515 would be unusual for │
│ Type I X-ray bursts, which typically exhibit a gradual and exponential       │
│ decay. However, note that most Type I X-ray bursters were observed by the    │
│ Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (\emph{RXTE}) \citep{1996SPIE.2808...59J}, which │
│ has a high time resolution. The low time resolution of \emph{Chandra} may    │
│ have obscured such a decay for XRT,200515. Moreover, most Type I bursts tend │
│ to repeat every few hours \citep{galloway08}; instead, XRT,200515 is the     │
│ only event detected at that location over a total observed time of           │
│ $\sim$150,ks. No LMXB has ever been noted at that position before or after   │
│ the event. The time interval between bursts is related to an index $\alpha$  │
│ defined as the ratio between the integrated persistent fluence between       │
│ subsequent bursts and the burst fluence; from a comparison of the energy     │
│ released by accretion (contributing to the persistent fluence) and by        │
│ thermonuclear burning (burst fluence), we expect $\alpha \gtrsim 40$, in     │
│ agreement with the observations of Type I bursts \citep{galloway08}. If we   │
│ apply the same criterion ($\alpha \gtrsim 40$) to the persistent and flare   │
│ fluences of XRT,200515, we would have to wait $>$10$^{7}$,s (4 months) to    │
│ observe another similar event, assuming the persistent flux level upper      │
│ limit in ObsID 23022 before the transient event. This waiting time extends   │
│ to at least one year if we assume the persistent flux upper limit derived    │
│ from the stacked $\sim$150,ks \emph{Chandra} observations. Only a few        │
│ one-off bursts from Galactic neutron stars at a very low persistent          │
│ luminosity ($L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{32}$--$10^{33}$,erg/s) were found by         │
│ \cite{{cornelisse02a,cornelisse02b}} with estimated recurrence times of tens │
│ of years. The vast majority of Type I X-ray bursts are Galactic, due to      │
│ their lower flux at large distances. Only a handful of extragalactic Type I  │
│ X-ray bursts are documented, for example in M,31 \citep{2020A&A...640A.124P} │
│ and the Magellanic Bridge \citep{2023A&A...669A..66H}. If XRT,200515 is a    │
│ Type I X-ray burst, it is the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burster in    │
│ the LMC and represents the tip of the iceberg for a vast population of faint │
│ LMXBs in nearby galaxies, too dim to be detected by {\it{Chandra}} or        │
│ {\it{XMM-Newton}}, but which may occasionally reveal themselves via          │
│ thermonuclear bursts with a long duty cycle.                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsubsection{Concluding Remarks and Outlook for XRT,200515}                │
│                                                                              │
│ XRT,200515 is a unique and intriguing extragalactic $\emph{Chandra}$ FXT.    │
│ The combination of its temporal and spectral properties is unlike any of the │
│ other $\emph{Chandra}$ FXT samples. Based on our analysis, the two most      │
│ likely scenarios for XRT,200515 are: (i) a distant GMF from a SGR behind the │
│ LMC; the first observed in the low X-ray energy band, missed by any other    │
│ high-energy facilities, or (ii) an unusual Type I X-ray burst from a         │
│ previously unknown faint LMXB; the first extragalactic X-ray burster in the  │
│ LMC. Nevertheless, both of these interpretations come with their own unique  │
│ challenges. XRT,200515 could, in fact, represent an entirely new type of     │
│ astronomical phenomenon. After all, the primary objective of our work was to │
│ use machine learning to find rare, needle-in-the-haystack anomalies hidden   │
│ within vast astronomical datasets. We invite further detailed studies of     │
│ XRT,200515 to evaluate our interpretations and explore alternative           │
│ scenarios, such as potential associations with a fast radio burst (FRB) or a │
│ SBO. We highly recommend follow-up multi-band observations at the source     │
│ coordinates of XRT,200515 to better constrain its nature. Lastly, we note    │
│ that XRT,200515 and the second transient discovered by                       │
│ \cite{2015MNRAS.450.3765G}, XRT,120830, have remarkably similar temporal     │
│ evolutions in their lightcurves (J. Irwin, personal communication, November  │
│ 2024), however with very different spectral properties ($\Gamma\sim2.5$ for  │
│ XRT,120830 versus $\Gamma\sim[NUMERICAL_RESULT]$ for XRT,200515). We leave a │
│ detailed comparative analysis of these transients for future work.           │
│                                                                              │

│ The main technical caveat of our approach is related to the representation   │
│ of event files. While our new event file representations enable a simple,    │
│ yet powerful representation learning approach to find new and rare X-ray     │
│ transients, any simplification of raw event files, like the fixed number of  │
│ time bins we use across all event files, is associated with a loss of        │
│ information. This could lead to us missing a small amount of transients. To  │
│ minimize this, we have implemented a rigorous approach to justify the        │
│ resolution of the event file representations in \S~\ref{sec:datarepp}.       │
│ Moreover, flares, in particular known extragalactic FXTs, cluster notably    │
│ well in our representation spaces. This is because their distinctive         │
│ features are less dependent on the temporal binning resolution in the        │
│ $E-t$,Maps and $E-t-dt$,Cubes. To improve the effectiveness of dip searches  │
│ with our proposed method, we suggest using higher resolution event file      │
│ representations. Nevertheless, our comprehensive transient candidate catalog │
│ includes numerous newly identified transients that were previously           │
│ overlooked by other X-ray transient searches in the \emph{Chandra} archive.  │
│ Among these is the remarkable needle-in-the-haystack event XRT,200515        │
│ discovered in this work, underscoring the effectiveness of our method. A     │
│ follow-up representation learning algorithm will learn informative features  │
│ from raw and unbinned event files while accounting for the Poisson nature of │
│ X-ray observations (Song et al., 2025, in preparation).                      │

│ \begin{enumerate} \item We introduce novel event file representations, the   │
│ \textit{E-t},Maps and \textit{E-t-dt},Cubes, which capture both temporal and │
│ spectral information.                                                        │

│ \item We apply two feature extraction methods to the event file              │
│ representations, PCA and sparse autoencoder neural networks, to extract or   │
│ learn informative features that can be utilized for downstream tasks, such   │
│ as unsupervised classification or anomaly detection.                         │
│                                                                              │
│ \item We project the learned features to two-dimensional embedding spaces,   │
│ enabling interpretable queries of analogs to objects of interest based on    │
│ their temporal and spectral properties.                                      │

│ \item We cluster the embedding spaces with DBSCAN, successfully isolating    │
│ previously identified X-ray transients. We identify new transient candidates │
│ within specific transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbor      │
│ searches using kNN.                                                          │

│ \item We compile a catalog of the X-ray transient candidates, including      │
│ 3,447 flares and 112 dips, and make it openly accessible to the community    │
│ and the broader scientific audience.                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ \item We report the discovery of XRT,200515, a rare extragalactic FXT        │
│ characterized by unique temporal and spectral features. We explore its       │
│ potential origins and suggest that it may be associated with one of the      │
│ following scenarios, presented in no particular order: \begin{itemize} \item │
│ A rare GMF from an SGR behind the LMC, marking the first GMF detected in the │
│ low X-ray energy range covered by telescopes like \emph{Chandra},            │
│ \emph{XMM-Newton}, \emph{Swift-XRT}, \emph{eROSITA}, or \emph{Einstein       │
│ Probe}. \item A rare extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint LMXB in   │
│ the LMC, representing the first such detection in the LMC. \item A new type  │
│ of astronomical phenomenon and a genuine anomaly, previously hidden in the   │
│ vast \emph{Chandra} archive. \end{itemize} XRT,200515 was only detected by   │
│ \emph{Chandra}, with no identified optical counterparts. We strongly         │
│ encourage a multi-wavelength search for additional signals from the source   │
│ associated with XRT,200515 to better understand its origin and nature.       │

│ Below, we summarize the optimization strategy for the t-SNE and DBSCAN       │
│ hyperparameters. For even more details on this approach, please refer to     │
│ \cite{sdthesis}.                                                             │
│                                                                              │
│ \subsection{t-SNE Hyperparameters}                                           │
│                                                                              │
│ The choice of the \texttt{perplexity} and \texttt{learning_rate} can have a  │
│ large impact on the resulting t-SNE embedding space. Ideally, we want the    │
│ two-dimensional embedding space to effectively capture both energy           │
│ information (hardness ratio $HR$) and variability information (variability   │
│ probability $p_{\rm var}$). Therefore, event files with similar values for   │
│ $HR$ and $p_{\rm var}$ should live close to each other in the embedding      │
│ space. We can use this information to define a performance metric for        │
│ different t-SNE hyperparameter inputs. First, we compute the pairwise        │
│ distance matrix $\mathbf{D_{Z}}$ of size $(m,m)$, where the distance         │
│ $D_{Z_{ij}}$ between points $i$ and $j$ is computed using a Euclidean        │
│ distance metric. Next, we define the property vector $\mathbf{Y}$, which     │
│ includes $7$ CSC properties (hardness ratios $HR_{\rm hm}$, $HR_{\rm hs}$,   │
│ $HR_{\rm ms}$ and variability probabilities $p_{\rm var}^{\rm b}$, $p_{\rm   │
│ var}^{\rm h}$, $p_{\rm var}^{\rm m}$, $p_{\rm var}^{\rm s}$) for each event  │
│ file. As a measure of similarity between the properties of different points, │
│ we can again compute a pairwise similarity matrix $\mathbf{D_{Y}}$ of size   │
│ $(m,m)$. To compute the similarity distance $D_{Y_{ij}}$ between sample $i$  │
│ and $j$, we use the Mahalanobis distance metric                              │
│ \citep{mahalanobis1936generalised}. Unlike the Euclidean distance metric,    │
│ the Mahalanobis distance metric accounts for the correlation between         │
│ different labels by taking into account the covariance structure of the      │
│ data. Note that our hardness ratios are correlated with each other, and that │
│ the same holds for the variability probabilities. Accounting for these       │
│ correlations provides a more accurate measure of the similarity distance     │
│ between different samples. Having computed $\mathbf{D_{Z}}$ and              │
│ $\mathbf{D_{Y}}$, we can define a performance metric that allows us to       │
│ compare the performance of different t-SNE hyperparameters. The smaller the  │
│ distance $D_{Z_{ij}}$ between two points $i$ and $j$ in the t-SNE embedding, │
│ the smaller should be difference in their associated labels as measured by   │
│ the distance $D_{Y_{ij}}$. We can thus define a performance metric based on  │
│ the statistical correlation of $\mathbf{D_{Z}}$ and $\mathbf{D_{Y}}$ using   │
│ the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient $\rho_{ZY}$                      │
│ \citep{spearman1904proof}. The higher $\rho_{ZY}$, the higher is the         │
│ positive correlation between $\mathbf{D_{Z}}$ and $\mathbf{D_{Y}}$ and the   │
│ better the performance of the t-SNE embedding. The hyperparameter space is   │
│ given by the ranges \texttt{learning_rate} \in (20,200) with a step size of  │
│ 20 and \texttt{perplexity} \in (10,100) with a step size of 10. This         │
│ optimization process is performed using a reduced dataset of 15,353 samples  │
│ for 2,000 iterations per hyperparameter combination due to computational     │
│ constraints. While subsampling, the overall structure of the data was        │
│ preserved by selecting the same distributions between any combinations of    │
│ hard, medium, soft, variable and non-variable samples. This ensures that the │
│ sample set is representative of the original data. We choose the             │
│ hyperparameter combination that produces the highest value of $\rho_{ZY}$.   │
│ \subsection{DBSCAN Hyperparameters}                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ Different hyperparameter combinations of \texttt{eps} and \texttt{minPts}    │
│ can have a large impact on the resulting DBSCAN clusters. We use a           │
│ combination of the Davies-Bouldin index $DB$ \citep{davies1979cluster} and   │
│ Calinski-Harabasz index $CH$ \citep{calinski1974dendrite} as a performance   │
│ metric to find the optimal DBSCAN hyperparameter inputs. The $DB$ index is a │
│ measure of the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar  │
│ cluster, relative to the average distance between points within each         │
│ cluster. The $DB$ index is given by the following formula: \begin{equation}  │
│ DB = \frac{1}{n_c} \sum_{i=1}^{n_c} \max_{j \neq i} \left(\frac{W_i +        │
│ W_j}{d(c_i, c_j)}\right), \label{DB} \end{equation} where $n_c$ is the       │
│ number of clusters, $W_i$ and $W_j$ are the within-cluster sum of squares    │
│ for cluster $i$ and $j$, and $d(c_i, c_j)$ is the distance between the       │
│ centroids of clusters $i$ and $j$. On the other hand, the $CH$ index is      │
│ based on the concept that good clusters should have high intra-cluster       │
│ similarity (cohesion) measured by the between-cluster dispersion $B$ and low │
│ inter-cluster similarity (separation) measured by the within-cluster         │
│ dispersion $W$. $B$ is the sum of the pairwise distances between cluster     │
│ centroids, and $W$ is the sum of the pairwise distances between points       │
│ within each cluster. The $CH$ index is given by the following formula:       │
│ \begin{equation} CH = \frac{B}{W} \times \frac{m - n_c}{n_c - 1}, \label{CH} │
│ \end{equation} where the scaling factor $\frac{m-n_c}{n_c-1}$ accounts for   │
│ the total number of data points $m$ and the number of clusters $n_c$. A      │
│ lower $DB$ index and higher $CH$ index indicate that the clustering          │
│ algorithm is more effective in grouping similar data points together and     │
│ separating different data points into distinct clusters. We thus define the  │
│ performance metric $\rho_{DC}$ as the ratio of the normalized indices $DB_n  │
│ = \frac{DB}{\text{max}(DB)}$ and $CH_n = \frac{CH}{\text{max}(CH)}$ in the   │
│ hyperparameter space given by $\texttt{eps} \in (1.0,3.0)$ with a step size  │
│ of $0.1$ and $\texttt{minPts} \in (10,30)$ with a step size of $1$:          │
│ \begin{equation} \rho_{DBSCAN} = \frac{CH_n}{DB_n}. \end{equation}           │
│                                                                              │
│ We choose the hyperparameter combination that produces the highest value of  │
│ $\rho_{DBSCAN}$.                                                             │

│ Follow the paper's methodology and the instructions precisely to reproduce   │
│ the specified result. Remember to save results and code to permanent files,  │
│ as your code execution environment is ephemeral. Comment your code clearly   │
│ and make explicit note of all of your thoughts or decisions. Make sure to    │
│ handle all data loading, processing, and computation steps necessary for the │
│ task. Do not give up until you have made a solid effort at reproducing the   │
│ results! You must execute code using your given tools, not just produce a    │
│ plan.                                                                        │

│ Please remember the following important tips about tool usage:               │
│                                                                              │
│  • The execute_python tool is ephemeral, so any variables or states will not │
│    be saved. You must save your work to files for persistence.               │
│  • Do not use the timeout parameter with the execute_python tool             │
│  • Always use ABSOLUTE paths. Use pwd in your home (starting) directory to   │
│    get your absolute path. This is where you should write files. Example (if │
│    pwd shows /tmp/tmp123456): { "command": "create", "path":                 │
│    "/tmp/tmp123456/filename.py", "file_text": "# Your code here" }           │
│                                                                              │
│ Remember, this is a test of the paper's reproducibility. This means you      │
│ should implement the paper's methodology from scratch on your own. Many      │
│ tasks will involve significant challenges, computational complexity, code    │
│ implementation, and trial and error. This is an extremely difficult task,    │
│ but is extremely important for the future of scientific research.            │
